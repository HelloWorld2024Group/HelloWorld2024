Gen. John F. Kelly, that the former president meets the definition of a fascist. Mr. Kelly also described Mr. Trump as offering praise for Hitler.\\n\\nMr. Adams, mayor of America’s largest city and one of the country’s most prominent Black elected officials, was briefing reporters about security plans ahead of Mr. Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden when he was asked if he believed the former president was a fascist.'}, {'content': 'Mayor Eric Adams did not attend the first candidate forum for the New York City mayoral race, but his record — and the criminal charges he faces — received plenty of attention on Saturday from the Democrats who are running to unseat him.\\n\\nThe attacks covered Mr. Adams’s indictment on federal corruption charges last month, but even more criticism was heaped on his budget cuts to free preschool, stalled bus improvements and his response to the city’s affordability crisis.\\n\\n“Eric Adams promised to be the mayor for communities like yours, and long before all of these corruption scandals, he has failed to do so,” Brad Lander, the city comptroller, said at the forum at a church in the Bronx. “Let’s be clear: You deserve a safer, more affordable, more livable and better-run city.”'}, {'content': 'For years, villagers who lived near the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria had told government officials that the structure was broken and the reservoir behind it too full.\\n\\nBut in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.\\n\\n“The dam is not broken,” Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. “People should not be afraid.”\\n\\nFour days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.'}, {'content': 'Japanese voters are not accustomed to nail-biter elections.\\n\\nBut as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday, the party that has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955 is facing the possibility that it could lose its majority in the body’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives.\\n\\nJust one month after a leadership vote by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party anointed Shigeru Ishiba as the new prime minister, the party entered the election under considerable pressure from a public angered by a long-simmering political finance scandal, rising inflation and the burdens of raising families.\\n\\nThat does not necessarily mean that Japanese voters are ready to hand the government to a divided and enfeebled political opposition, which last won a general election 15 years ago. Analysts said it was likely that the incumbent party would either eke out just enough seats to retain parliamentary power or would be forced to bring on new coalition partners to remain in charge.\\n\\n“What is most interesting about this election is its uncertainty,” said Masaru Kohno, a political scientist at Waseda University in Tokyo.'}, {'content': 'It was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.\\n\\nFor centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K. Jagadish, an official at a state-owned dairy.\\n\\nLast month, the state’s newly elected chief minister, a Hindu named N. Chandrababu Naidu, accused his Christian predecessor of allowing the temple’s laddu to be made in ghee, a clarified butter, that was adulterated with other animal fats. A majority of the temple’s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu’s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.\\n\\nThe case of the temple sweet shows how India’s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.'}, {'content': 'A piercing alarm burst from millions of cellphones, a signal to hundreds of thousands of people to pack their bags and flee one of Europe’s most dangerous volcanoes. But most of the Italians who heard it shrugged.\\n\\nIt was around 5 o’clock on a Friday afternoon, and the alert wasn’t announcing a real crisis.\\n\\nInstead, it was part of a four-day drill this month, coordinated by the Italian civil protection department, to prepare a densely populated area near Naples for the day its residents might face a host of volcanic perils: The ground buckling underfoot. Ribbons of toxic fumes. Exploding boils of molten rock.\\n\\nThe threat does not loom on the horizon, like nearby Mount Vesuvius to the east. Instead, an eight-mile-wide caldera — riddled with volcanoes — is recessed in the earth and sea west of Naples, forming what is called the Campi Flegrei, or “burning fields.”'}, {'content': 'It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest. He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities — wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline — that he most lacks.\\n\\nThose disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates.\\n\\nThis unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.\\n\\nFor this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.'}, {'content': 'Usually, I get political wisdom from Rahm Emanuel, not his brother Ari.\\n\\nBut a quote from Ari, the Hollywood macher, to Puck’s Matthew Belloni about the gender chasm in 2024 caught my eye.\\n\\n“This election is gonna come down to probably 120,000 votes,” Ari said. “You probably have 60 percent of the male vote for Trump, and the female vote is 60-40 for Kamala. It’s a jump ball. We’re gonna find out who wants this more — men or women.”\\n\\nAre we back to the days of Mars versus Venus? Or did we never leave?\\n\\nIt is the ultimate battle of the sexes in the most visceral of elections. Who will prevail? The women, especially young women, who are appalled at the cartoonish macho posturing and benighted stances of Donald Trump and his entourage? Or the men, including many young men, union men, Latino and Black men, who are drawn to Trump’s swaggering, bullying and insulting, seeing him as the reeling-backward antidote to shrinking male primacy.\\n\\nDrilling into the primal yearnings of men and women — their priorities, identities, anger and frustration — makes this election even more fraught. When I wrote a book about gender in 2005, I assumed that, a couple of decades later, we’d all be living peacefully on the same planet. But no Cassandra, I. The sexual revolution intensified our muddle, leaving women in a tangle of dependence and independence in the 21st century. The more we imitated men, the more we realized how different we were.'}, {'content': 'What should we think as Donald Trump urges people to vote in January, confuses places and names, fumbles for words, simplifies his speech patterns, describes recent experiences that did not happen and in public seems increasingly vulgar, menacing and unfiltered?\\n\\nWhen President Biden showed his age and stumbled through the June presidential debate, I was among the first commentators to call on him to withdraw from the race. So what about the 78-year-old Republican nominee? Frankly, I wavered about writing this column, for there is an unfortunate history, notably during Barry Goldwater’s run for president in 1964, of using quasi-medical language to undermine candidates one disapproves of. That is grounds for great caution. But if we’re trying to gauge a nominee’s fitness for office over the next four years, we also should acknowledge questions of Trump’s aging and capacity to do the job, as we did with Biden.\\n\\nIt’s unarguable that Trump is acting even more erratically than he has in the past. It’s also indisputable that Trump is at an age when many people see a physical or mental decline over the following four years. Perhaps one lesson from the Biden agonistes of this summer is that just as companies move C.E.O.s out before they struggle, we should be wary of electing elderly presidents from either party.\\n\\nLet’s acknowledge the risks of armchair analysis at a distance and note that Trump still has physical vigor and a defense against suggestions of cognitive decline: For decades, he has behaved outrageously and sometimes been rewarded for it. And some people do not think Trump’s behavior is related to aging. Mark Esper, an honorable man who was Trump’s defense secretary and has criticized him as a “threat to democracy,” told me that Trump looks older to him but not obviously changed beyond that.'}, {'content': 'Everywhere you look these days, people are turning away from alcohol. First there was Dry January. Now there’s Sober October. Who knows what month the rhyme scheme will come for next? Parched March? Modest August?\\n\\nI admire these teetotalers. I too have abstained from liquor for extended periods and felt the clean poise and composure that replaces the low-grade hum of constant alcohol in the system. I met my wife during one such cleareyed abstention, so I know its value.\\n\\nBut I will not be joining the abstainers. I’m unwilling to part with wine.\\n\\nIt’s not because I’m chasing tipsiness — as someone who writes about wine, I often taste 50 to 60 glasses in a day, though I always spit them out and, in six years of drinking wine seriously, I haven’t once been drunk on it. But in a life that too often feels stripped of magic — whether because of our political hostility, the radical inequality in our society or the instantaneity required of everything — wine is a passport to transcendence. If water is life-giving, wine is psychedelic.\\n\\nSometimes, the aroma alone is enough to kick off the time travel. Last summer, my wife and I took our daughter to Istanbul. We visited Wayana, a wine bar that focuses on indigenous Turkish grapes, and I asked for a glass of Kalecik Karasi, the country’s flagship red varietal, which makes light-bodied, red-fruited reds sometimes compared with pinot noir. When I stuck my nose in the glass, however, I wasn’t in Burgundy. I wasn’t even in Istanbul. I was 6 years old, in my grandmother’s kitchen in Soviet Minsk, smelling the tart sweetness of her raspberry jam, made from berries we’d picked in the countryside, as it bubbled away on the stove, the sunlight streaming through the window. Then, necessarily, the transport was over — miraculous for being so fleeting.'}, {'content': 'As lawyers for Daniel Penny, a former Marine accused of choking a homeless man to death in a New York subway car, vetted jurors Friday, a woman sat at a courtroom table, leaning toward the people being questioned and scribbling in a notebook.\\n\\nThe woman, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant for the defendant, has been in Manhattan criminal court every day as scores of prospective jurors arrive for selection in a case that has divided New Yorkers from the moment the video of Mr. Penny holding the homeless man, Jordan Neely, on the subway floor ricocheted around the internet in May 2023.\\n\\nHowever, Mr. Penny, who faces charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, is far from her most high-profile client.\\n\\nMs. Dimitrius, whose clients have spanned the spectrum from celebrities to corporations to the president of Brazil, worked with lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse, who in 2021 was acquitted of killing two people and wounding another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Wisconsin. In 1994, O.J. Simpson’s team hired her to help select a favorable jury. Before that, she worked with defense lawyers in three cases that arose from the beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991, an episode that set off rioting.'}, {'content': 'The heat stroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.\\n\\nHe is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.\\n\\nMid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.\\n\\nMr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.'}, {'content': 'Sitting against a chain-link fence under the shade of a tree in the company parking lot, commiserating over small talk and cigarettes with fellow assembly workers, one of the imprisoned men, Carlos Anderson, argued that his predicament was simple. He could work a 40-hour week, at $12 an hour — and keep a small fraction of that after the state charges transportation and laundry fees, and takes a 40 percent cut of pretax wages — or he could face working for nothing at the prison.\\n\\nUnder Alabama prison rules, there are thin lines between work incentives, forced labor and “involuntary servitude” — which reforms to the Alabama Constitution in 2022 banned. From the viewpoint of Mr. Anderson and more than a dozen other Alabama inmates interviewed by The New York Times, the ultimate message, in practice, is straightforward: Do this, or else.'}, {'content': 'Late in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters. It soon came out that at least one of them was a student and former member of the Israel Defense Forces. The university suspended him.\\n\\nSome students who had been sprayed with the strange emission were certain that it was “skunk water,” a chemical the I.D.F. deploys to subdue crowds in the West Bank. Speaking to The Columbia Spectator, the student newspaper, they described feeling sick afterward. Later, the student who had been an I.D.F soldier filed a lawsuit against Columbia claiming that his disciplinary proceedings had been “flawed, biased and deficient.” His lawyers argued that he had merely engaged in a “harmless expression” of speech by spritzing the protesters with foul “novelty sprays” — which Columbia, seven months later, acknowledged they were — “purchased on Amazon for $26.11.”\\n\\nDiscussing the episode on the left-leaning radio and television platform Democracy Now!, Ms. Franke said that she and others had long been concerned about older Israeli exchange students “coming right out of their military service” because they had been known to “harass” Palestinian students and others on campus.\\n\\nFrom this observation followed a cascade of accusations and legal entanglements that have spread beyond the fractious world of the academy to illuminate some of the extreme steps that elite law firms have taken since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas to distance themselves from Palestinian sympathies.'}, {'content': 'What about the Row makes its take on a simple sweater that much better than a version by, say, the Gap?\\n\\nThe Row, a luxury label founded in 2006 by Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen, has become widely recognized — revered, even, by certain fashion writers — for its interpretations of wardrobe staples sold at big-box chains and high-end department stores alike.\\n\\nIt has also become known for the prices it charges for such items: $1,420 for a turtleneck, $990 for jeans, $1,490 for a pair of sneakers, $990 for silk-and-acetate hotel-style slippers. Those prices, along with the clothing’s unadorned nature, placed the Row among the brands emblematic of the trend known as quiet luxury, a form of cosplay associated with “old money” dress codes.\\n\\nOccasionally, the Row will offer deep discounts on its products at sample sales, like one held this week at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan.

Gen. John F. Kelly, that the former president meets the definition of a fascist. Mr. Kelly also described Mr. Trump as offering praise for Hitler.\\n\\nMr. Adams, mayor of America’s largest city and one of the country’s most prominent Black elected officials, was briefing reporters about security plans ahead of Mr. Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden when he was asked if he believed the former president was a fascist.', 'Mayor Eric Adams did not attend the first candidate forum for the New York City mayoral race, but his record — and the criminal charges he faces — received plenty of attention on Saturday from the Democrats who are running to unseat him.\\n\\nThe attacks covered Mr. Adams’s indictment on federal corruption charges last month, but even more criticism was heaped on his budget cuts to free preschool, stalled bus improvements and his response to the city’s affordability crisis.\\n\\n“Eric Adams promised to be the mayor for communities like yours, and long before all of these corruption scandals, he has failed to do so,” Brad Lander, the city comptroller, said at the forum at a church in the Bronx. “Let’s be clear: You deserve a safer, more affordable, more livable and better-run city.”', 'For years, villagers who lived near the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria had told government officials that the structure was broken and the reservoir behind it too full.\\n\\nBut in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.\\n\\n“The dam is not broken,” Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. “People should not be afraid.”\\n\\nFour days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.', 'Japanese voters are not accustomed to nail-biter elections.\\n\\nBut as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday, the party that has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955 is facing the possibility that it could lose its majority in the body’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives.\\n\\nJust one month after a leadership vote by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party anointed Shigeru Ishiba as the new prime minister, the party entered the election under considerable pressure from a public angered by a long-simmering political finance scandal, rising inflation and the burdens of raising families.\\n\\nThat does not necessarily mean that Japanese voters are ready to hand the government to a divided and enfeebled political opposition, which last won a general election 15 years ago. Analysts said it was likely that the incumbent party would either eke out just enough seats to retain parliamentary power or would be forced to bring on new coalition partners to remain in charge.\\n\\n“What is most interesting about this election is its uncertainty,” said Masaru Kohno, a political scientist at Waseda University in Tokyo.', 'It was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.\\n\\nFor centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K. Jagadish, an official at a state-owned dairy.\\n\\nLast month, the state’s newly elected chief minister, a Hindu named N. Chandrababu Naidu, accused his Christian predecessor of allowing the temple’s laddu to be made in ghee, a clarified butter, that was adulterated with other animal fats. A majority of the temple’s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu’s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.\\n\\nThe case of the temple sweet shows how India’s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.', 'A piercing alarm burst from millions of cellphones, a signal to hundreds of thousands of people to pack their bags and flee one of Europe’s most dangerous volcanoes.

First there was Dry January. Now there’s Sober October. Who knows what month the rhyme scheme will come for next? Parched March? Modest August?\\n\\nI admire these teetotalers. I too have abstained from liquor for extended periods and felt the clean poise and composure that replaces the low-grade hum of constant alcohol in the system. I met my wife during one such cleareyed abstention, so I know its value.\\n\\nBut I will not be joining the abstainers. I’m unwilling to part with wine.\\n\\nIt’s not because I’m chasing tipsiness — as someone who writes about wine, I often taste 50 to 60 glasses in a day, though I always spit them out and, in six years of drinking wine seriously, I haven’t once been drunk on it.

If water is life-giving, wine is psychedelic.\\n\\nSometimes, the aroma alone is enough to kick off the time travel. Last summer, my wife and I took our daughter to Istanbul. We visited Wayana, a wine bar that focuses on indigenous Turkish grapes, and I asked for a glass of Kalecik Karasi, the country’s flagship red varietal, which makes light-bodied, red-fruited reds sometimes compared with pinot noir. When I stuck my nose in the glass, however, I wasn’t in Burgundy. I wasn’t even in Istanbul. I was 6 years old, in my grandmother’s kitchen in Soviet Minsk, smelling the tart sweetness of her raspberry jam, made from berries we’d picked in the countryside, as it bubbled away on the stove, the sunlight streaming through the window. Then, necessarily, the transport was over — miraculous for being so fleeting.', 'As lawyers for Daniel Penny, a former Marine accused of choking a homeless man to death in a New York subway car, vetted jurors Friday, a woman sat at a courtroom table, leaning toward the people being questioned and scribbling in a notebook.\\n\\nThe woman, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant for the defendant, has been in Manhattan criminal court every day as scores of prospective jurors arrive for selection in a case that has divided New Yorkers from the moment the video of Mr. Penny holding the homeless man, Jordan Neely, on the subway floor ricocheted around the internet in May 2023.\\n\\nHowever, Mr. Penny, who faces charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, is far from her most high-profile client.\\n\\nMs. Dimitrius, whose clients have spanned the spectrum from celebrities to corporations to the president of Brazil, worked with lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse, who in 2021 was acquitted of killing two people and wounding another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Wisconsin. In 1994, O.J. Simpson’s team hired her to help select a favorable jury. Before that, she worked with defense lawyers in three cases that arose from the beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991, an episode that set off rioting.', 'The heat stroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.\\n\\nHe is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.\\n\\nMid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.\\n\\nMr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.', 'Sitting against a chain-link fence under the shade of a tree in the company parking lot, commiserating over small talk and cigarettes with fellow assembly workers, one of the imprisoned men, Carlos Anderson, argued that his predicament was simple. He could work a 40-hour week, at $12 an hour — and keep a small fraction of that after the state charges transportation and laundry fees, and takes a 40 percent cut of pretax wages — or he could face working for nothing at the prison.\\n\\nUnder Alabama prison rules, there are thin lines between work incentives, forced labor and “involuntary servitude” — which reforms to the Alabama Constitution in 2022 banned. From the viewpoint of Mr. Anderson and more than a dozen other Alabama inmates interviewed by The New York Times, the ultimate message, in practice, is straightforward: Do this, or else.', 'Late in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters. It soon came out that at least one of them was a student and former member of the Israel Defense Forces. The university suspended him.\\n\\nSome students who had been sprayed with the strange emission were certain that it was “skunk water,” a chemical the I.D.F. deploys to subdue crowds in the West Bank. Speaking to The Columbia Spectator, the student newspaper, they described feeling sick afterward. Later, the student who had been an I.D.F soldier filed a lawsuit against Columbia claiming that his disciplinary proceedings had been “flawed, biased and deficient.” His lawyers argued that he had merely engaged in a “harmless expression” of speech by spritzing the protesters with foul “novelty sprays” — which Columbia, seven months later, acknowledged they were — “purchased on Amazon for $26.11.”\\n\\nDiscussing the episode on the left-leaning radio and television platform Democracy Now!, Ms. Franke said that she and others had long been concerned about older Israeli exchange students “coming right out of their military service” because they had been known to “harass” Palestinian students and others on campus.\\n\\nFrom this observation followed a cascade of accusations and legal entanglements that have spread beyond the fractious world of the academy to illuminate some of the extreme steps that elite law firms have taken since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas to distance themselves from Palestinian sympathies.', 'What about the Row makes its take on a simple sweater that much better than a version by, say, the Gap?\\n\\nThe Row, a luxury label founded in 2006 by Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen, has become widely recognized — revered, even, by certain fashion writers — for its interpretations of wardrobe staples sold at big-box chains and high-end department stores alike.\\n\\nIt has also become known for the prices it charges for such items: $1,420 for a turtleneck, $990 for jeans, $1,490 for a pair of sneakers, $990 for silk-and-acetate hotel-style slippers.

But in his third presidential bid, those worries have metastasized into fear that another term for Mr. Trump would threaten the founding principles of the Republic.

But Vice President Kamala Harris has intensified her own alarms about Mr. Trump, switching the joyful tenor of the early days of her campaign to stark warnings that he would govern as an authoritarian and curtail what she casts as core American freedoms — like a woman’s right to terminate a life-threatening pregnancy.

King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991, an episode that set off rioting.\\tSitting against a chain-link fence under the shade of a tree in the company parking lot, commiserating over small talk and cigarettes with fellow assembly workers, one of the imprisoned men, Carlos Anderson, argued that his predicament was simple. He could work a 40-hour week, at $12 an hour — and keep a small fraction of that after the state charges transportation and laundry fees, and takes a 40 percent cut of pretax wages — or he could face working for nothing at the prison.\\n\\nUnder Alabama prison rules, there are thin lines between work incentives, forced labor and “involuntary servitude” — which reforms to the Alabama Constitution in 2022 banned. From the viewpoint of Mr. Anderson and more than a dozen other Alabama inmates interviewed by The New York Times, the ultimate message, in practice, is straightforward: Do this, or else.\\tLate in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters. It soon came out that at least one of them was a student and former member of the Israel Defense Forces. The university suspended him.\\n\\nSome students who had been sprayed with the strange emission were certain that it was “skunk water,” a chemical the I.D.F. deploys to subdue crowds in the West Bank. Speaking to The Columbia Spectator, the student newspaper, they described feeling sick afterward. Later, the student who had been an I.D.F soldier filed a lawsuit against Columbia claiming that his disciplinary proceedings had been “flawed, biased and deficient.” His lawyers argued that he had merely engaged in a “harmless expression” of speech by spritzing the protesters with foul “novelty sprays” — which Columbia, seven months later, acknowledged they were — “purchased on Amazon for $26.11.”\\n\\nDiscussing the episode on the left-leaning radio and television platform Democracy Now!, Ms. Franke said that she and others had long been concerned about older Israeli exchange students “coming right out of their military service” because they had been known to “harass” Palestinian students and others on campus.\\n\\nFrom this observation followed a cascade of accusations and legal entanglements that have spread beyond the fractious world of the academy to illuminate some of the extreme steps that elite law firms have taken since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas to distance themselves from Palestinian sympathies.', 'For years, villagers who lived near the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria had told government officials that the structure was broken and the reservoir behind it too full.\\n\\nBut in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.\\n\\n“The dam is not broken,” Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. “People should not be afraid.”\\n\\nFour days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.\\tIt was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.\\n\\nFor centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K. Jagadish, an official at a state-owned dairy.\\n\\nLast month, the state’s newly elected chief minister, a Hindu named N. Chandrababu Naidu, accused his Christian predecessor of allowing the temple’s laddu to be made in ghee, a clarified butter, that was adulterated with other animal fats. A majority of the temple’s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu’s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.\\n\\nThe case of the temple sweet shows how India’s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.', 'A piercing alarm burst from millions of cellphones, a signal to hundreds of thousands of people to pack their bags and flee one of Europe’s most dangerous volcanoes. But most of the Italians who heard it shrugged.\\n\\nIt was around 5 o’clock on a Friday afternoon, and the alert wasn’t announcing a real crisis.\\n\\nInstead, it was part of a four-day drill this month, coordinated by the Italian civil protection department, to prepare a densely populated area near Naples for the day its residents might face a host of volcanic perils: The ground buckling underfoot. Ribbons of toxic fumes. Exploding boils of molten rock.\\n\\nThe threat does not loom on the horizon, like nearby Mount Vesuvius to the east. Instead, an eight-mile-wide caldera — riddled with volcanoes — is recessed in the earth and sea west of Naples, forming what is called the Campi Flegrei, or “burning fields.”\\tThe heat stroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.\\n\\nHe is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.\\n\\nMid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.\\n\\nMr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.']\n",
