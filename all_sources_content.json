{"nytimes": ["Nearly half of all voters are skeptical that the American experiment in self-governance is working, with 45 percent believing that the nation\u2019s democracy does not do a good job representing ordinary people, according to a new New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nThree-quarters of voters in the United States say democracy is under threat, though their perception of the forces imperiling it vary widely based on partisan leanings. And a majority of voters believe that the country is plagued by corruption, with 62 percent saying that the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good.\n\nThe eroding faith in the nearly 250-year-old American system of government follows four years of unparalleled challenges: a violent riot in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the criminal conviction of former President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Trump\u2019s continued insistence that the democratic process is rigged.\n\nCoupled with stubborn inflation, divisive culture wars and geopolitical crises, voters are expressing exasperation with American politics and a government that they believe has failed to serve them at the most basic level.", "When former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s longest serving chief of staff said the other day that his old boss \u201cfalls into the general definition of fascist,\u201d Mr. Trump let loose with the insults, assailing his onetime right hand as a \u201ctotal degenerate,\u201d a \u201cLOWLIFE\u201d and a \u201cbad General.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Trump did not do, at least at first, was actually deny that he was or aspired to be a fascist.\n\nAny other politician might consider that a damning denunciation worth rebutting. Only when asked days later did he directly dismiss the idea. But in the nine years that he has been running for or serving as president, Mr. Trump has regularly evoked the language, history and motifs of fascism without hesitation or evident concern about how it would make him look.\n\nWhile presidents have pushed the boundaries of power, and in some cases abused it outright, no American commander in chief over the past couple of centuries has so aggressively sought to discredit the institutions of democracy at home while so openly embracing and envying dictators abroad. Although plenty of presidents have been called dictators by their opponents, none has been publicly accused of fascism by his own handpicked top adviser who spent day after day with him in the Oval Office.", "Fewer than 12,000 votes in Georgia were the difference between Joseph R.

One man lay entangled with a red bicycle. Some bodies had decomposed so badly in the summer heat that they had to be identified by their teeth, according to a volunteer who helped recover the remains.\n\nThe video and photographs that captured the scene were taken in the early days of Ukraine\u2019s offensive, the first invasion of Russian territory since World War II.

In the pilot, a high school football star is discovered dead. Suspicion turns to several of his classmates, members of a heavy metal band that exploits satanic imagery.\n\nThe aesthetics of \u201cHysteria!\u201d \u2014 the wallpaper, the jeans, the popular music \u2014 are distinctly \u201980s. But the impulse to displace social anxieties onto perceived groups of outsiders is as American as apple pie. (Are those apples poisoned? Do they have razor blades inside?) And in a culture of heightened political rhetoric and pervasive misinformation, as apparent now as it was five years ago, the distance between the satanic panic and current conspiracy theories \u2014 QAnon, say, or the supposed grooming of children by queer people \u2014 is a short one, barely the length of a suburban lawn.", "A tropical storm was heading toward Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast in late September when senior news and opinion leaders of The Washington Post flew into Miami for a periodic meeting with Jeff Bezos, the newspaper\u2019s billionaire owner.\n\nDuring their visit \u2014 which included a working lunch at Mr. Bezos\u2019 sprawling home on an exclusive island in Biscayne Bay and dinner at a nearby restaurant \u2014 David Shipley, The Post\u2019s opinion editor, and Will Lewis, The Post\u2019s chief executive and publisher, discussed plans for the future of the newspaper\u2019s opinion section. The election, less than 45 days away, loomed large.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, according to four people familiar with it who spoke on condition of anonymity to relay private conversations, it appeared to Mr. Shipley and Mr. Lewis that Mr. Bezos had reservations about the Post endorsing either candidate in that race. But they also thought he was open to persuasion.\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 ultimate decision, to end the Post\u2019s decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates, exploded into public view on Friday, drawing criticism from reporters, editors and readers, along with an unusual rebuke from legendary Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.", "For years, villagers who lived near the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria had told government officials that the structure was broken and the reservoir behind it too full.\n\nBut in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.\n\n\u201cThe dam is not broken,\u201d Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. \u201cPeople should not be afraid.\u201d\n\nFour days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.", "For two years, the Republican Pennridge School Board, north of Philadelphia, governed with a burst of ideological energy.

But a high-stakes campaign has flooded the state with social media and television ads, pressing voters to consider a major change to the public school system widely seen as the nation\u2019s best.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a generation of students has been required to complete standardized exams in English, math and the sciences to earn a high school diploma. The requirement is the capstone of a rigorous set of standards that have helped set the state apart from others on achievement tests.\n\nOn Election Day, Massachusetts voters will decide whether to change course.\n\nA ballot measure known as Question 2 would eliminate the exams as a graduation mandate. If it passes, there would be no statewide requirements for receiving a diploma.\n\nThe proposal has provoked sharp divisions among Democrats, who control the state government.\n\nThe state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, which spearheaded the ballot question, has poured millions into efforts to convince voters the exam shuts out teenagers who already have the odds stacked against them. They have pointed to research showing such mandates can push more disadvantaged students to drop out.", "Deep in the vault of the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan on a late-spring day, the curator Robinson McClellan was sorting through a collection of cultural memorabilia.

And here\u2019s a special treat: The superstar pianist Lang Lang recorded the waltz for The Times. You can watch his performance here.\n\nThe story of the long-lost waltz starts at the Morgan on a late-spring day, when the curator and composer Robinson McClellan came across an unusual musical manuscript. The piece was moody and melancholic, and a conspicuous name was written across the top: Chopin.\n\nMcClellan took a photo on his iPhone so he could play the piece back at home on his electric piano.

Rocking Ray-Bans and an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker on his lapel \u2014 it\u2019s the first day of early voting in Texas \u2014 he is easing his way across the parking lot of his local polling place, toward TV cameras set up beside his campaign bus. Backed by sign-waving fans, he starts his brief remarks, only to be interrupted by an angry man shouting from a few yards away: \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor to democracy!\u201d\n\nSome pro-Cruz women yell back, and the heckler wanders off through the parked cars. Mr. Cruz seems not to even notice, plowing ahead with his call to \u201cKeep Texas Texas\u201d \u2014 his campaign motto \u2014 and talking up jobs, freedom and security. (That last category consists largely of horrifying stories about violent crimes perpetrated by \u201cVenezuelan gang members.\u201d) He takes shots at his Democratic opponent, Representative Colin Allred, whom he calls a formidable candidate \u201cif he were running for City Council in San Francisco.\u201d (Mr. Cruz uses this line at multiple stops. It\u2019s a real crowd pleaser.) And when asked if he\u2019s concerned about the influx of new voters to Texas in recent years and the state\u2019s shifting demographics, he fires back with absolute confidence:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nWith his buoyant delivery and smug smile, Mr. Cruz wants to remind you of something: He is never happier than seeing a liberal fantasy and crushing it. The Democratic dream of turning Texas blue is approaching middle age with nothing to show for it, but this particular hope never dies \u2014 and the goal of ousting Mr. Cruz, a b\u00eate noire of Democrats if ever there were one, will endure as long as he\u2019s in office. As in his last race in 2018, he is Democrats\u2019 top Senate target this year, with recent polling showing him just a few measly points ahead of Mr. Allred, generally within the margin of error. And once again he is being dramatically out-raised by the Democrats, a disparity made worse by the millions of dollars that national Democratic groups are pouring into the contest. It\u2019s not just that the Democrats see unseating Mr. Cruz as their best shot at holding onto their Senate majority. They also see him as the most promising opportunity to break the Republican Party\u2019s multidecade lock on statewide offices here \u2014 giving them that first crucial step toward their dream of turning Texas, if not blue, then at least purple.\n\nBut don\u2019t look for Mr. Cruz to crumble. This is basically how he rolls. The senator was a divisive, bomb-throwing, lib-owning loudmouth years before Donald Trump entered the political arena, basking in his critics\u2019 hate as if it was winter sunshine. He is known for annoying his own teammates with bone-headed moves. (Remember \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d?) Yet he somehow manages to be disruptive and bombastic enough to impress Texas Republicans without alienating at least a portion of the state\u2019s independent voters. And his in-your-face partisanship may help him walk an ideological line that might trip up other, subtler Republicans.", "It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest. He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities \u2014 wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline \u2014 that he most lacks.\n\nThose disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates.\n\nThis unequivocal, dispiriting truth \u2014 Donald Trump is not fit to be president \u2014 should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.\n\nFor this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.", "I can think of some compelling reasons that leading independent newspapers should not be in the business of endorsing candidates for president.\n\nUnfortunately, the acts of self-sabotage by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times do not reflect any of them.

This inspired Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to whoop that even Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201cfellow Californians know she\u2019s not up for the job.\u201d The Times\u2019s editorial editor, Mariel Garza, resigned and said the decision made the organization look \u201ccraven and hypocritical.\u201d Others followed.\n\nThe Post\u2019s endorsement of Ms. Harris had reportedly already been drafted, only to be shelved on the orders of its owner, Amazon\u2019s founder, Mr. Bezos. But it fell to the paper\u2019s publisher, William Lewis, to announce the decision, saying, \u201cWe are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.\u201d Its editorial editor, David Shipley, in the face of his mutinous editorial board, said he owned the outcome, which he called a way of creating \u201cindependent space\u201d for voters to make up their own minds.", "I\u2019ve been wrong about many things, but here are two of the bigger whiffs of my professional life.\n\nI thought Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t find any meaningful support in the Republican Party. I watched his strange campaign announcement, complete with a partially paid crowd and a wild, rambling speech and thought, \u201cThis man is going nowhere.\u201d\n\nAnd I thought evangelical conservatives would be the firewall against his ascendancy, not his most loyal constituency and the fuel for the fire of his political comeback after Jan. 6. I never imagined the Christian devotion to Trump that we see today.\n\nI\u2019d been an evangelical my entire life and a Republican since my teenage years. I thought I knew my own community.

Analysts said it was likely that the incumbent party would either eke out just enough seats to retain parliamentary power or would be forced to bring on new coalition partners to remain in charge.\n\n\u201cWhat is most interesting about this election is its uncertainty,\u201d said Masaru Kohno, a political scientist at Waseda University in Tokyo.", "It was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.\n\nFor centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K. Jagadish, an official at a state-owned dairy.\n\nLast month, the state\u2019s newly elected chief minister, a Hindu named N. Chandrababu Naidu, accused his Christian predecessor of allowing the temple\u2019s laddu to be made in ghee, a clarified butter, that was adulterated with other animal fats. A majority of the temple\u2019s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu\u2019s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.\n\nThe case of the temple sweet shows how India\u2019s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.", "Late in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters. It soon came out that at least one of them was a student and former member of the Israel Defense Forces. The university suspended him.\n\nSome students who had been sprayed with the strange emission were certain that it was \u201cskunk water,\u201d a chemical the I.D.F. deploys to subdue crowds in the West Bank.

Rios and Cisneros were both sentenced to 50 years in federal prison and Contreras was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison, according to the US Attorney\u2019s Office. Grisham pleaded guilty to violent crime in aid of racketeering and is expected to be sentenced in September.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nFederal prosecutors charged three alleged gang members and one alleged gang associate Thursday in the fatal shooting of off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer Fernando Arroyos during an attempted robbery.\n\nLuis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio\u2019s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos\u2019 neck.\n\nThere was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.\n\nThe four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Public Defender\u2019s office in an attempt to contact legal representation for the defendants and is awaiting a response.\n\nArroyos, 27, \u201cwas starting a very promising career,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday.

Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time \u2013 or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not).\n\nHere\u2019s some advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled.\n\nBefore you go to the airport\n\nCheck the status of your flight before you head to the airport. If your flight has been canceled, you could save yourself the hassle of a trip to a busy airport. Pattarisara Suvichanarakul/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nAs bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it\u2019s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.\n\n\u201cCheck your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,\u201d said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. \u201cSave yourself the drive to the airport.\u201d\n\nOther tips from Keyes:\n\nSign up for airlines\u2019 free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. Also, download your carrier\u2019s app.\n\nPut your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the flight status that way.\n\nCheck the website FlightAware for larger flight trends across the country.\n\nHop on waiver offers ahead of bad weather quickly. Early birds have the best choices of the remaining seats and flights.\n\nIf you\u2019re at the airport already\n\nTravelers look at the departure information at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. If your flight is delayed or canceled after you've already arrived, make a beeline to the airline agents' desk. Julien De Rosa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you\u2019ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?\n\nKeyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents\u2019 desk. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make a difference who arrives first. It\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,\u201d Keyes said.\n\nThen you might want to call up your carrier while you\u2019re waiting. It might be faster to get through to a call center. \u201cWhatever happens first, great,\u201d he said.\n\nOther tactics you can try:\n\nGo to a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines and United Airlines advise.\n\nUse social media to your advantage, the travel advice website Travel Lens suggests. Try contacting the airline via X or other platforms when calls aren\u2019t going through.\n\nTry an international call center for your carrier, Keyes suggests. Calls to US domestic numbers might have longer waits.\n\nAttitude and research matter\n\nA Southwest Airlines employee assists a passenger during check-in at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference.\n\n\u201cHoney attracts more flies than vinegar,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cLook at this from the airline agents\u2019 perspective. \u2026 The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.\u201d\n\nHe had another tip when it\u2019s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: \u201cCome prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.\u201d\n\nOther considerations:\n\nBook directly with an airline if the price is the same. If you\u2019ve booked through a third-party site, you\u2019ll have to deal through them when there\u2019s a cancellation.\n\nAvoid layovers when booking if possible, the consumer advocacy group US PIRG suggests. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.\n\nRegarding tarmac delays, airlines must provide working bathrooms the entire time, US PIRG says. \u201cAfter two hours, you must have food and water. After three hours, you must be in the air or back in the airport \u2013 or the airline faces massive fines.\u201d\n\nHelp from other airlines\n\nCooperation between airlines could work in your favor.\n\n\u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.\n\n\u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d\n\nFrequent flyer miles\n\nTravelers wait in line to pass through security at Denver International Airport in Colorado on December 28, 2022. The winter holiday travel season can be particularly crowded and stressful. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\n\nThanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of Points Path, told CNN Travel in an email\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them. But you could save yourself some significant cash if you\u2019re trying to evacuate away from a storm,\u201d Kheel said.\n\n\u201cMost US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don\u2019t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don\u2019t end up using so you can get your miles back.\u201d\n\nTrapped for the night\n\nPassengers take a nap on the floor as they wait for their flights at the Guadalajara International Airport in Mexico on July 14, 2024. Sometimes, if might be easier to hunker down at the airport rather than scramble for a hotel room during a flight delay. Ulises Ruiz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat do you do if it looks like you\u2019re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you\u2019re not in your home city?\n\n\u201cAsk the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It\u2019s not required by law,\u201d Keyes said. They\u2019re less likely to do it there\u2019s a weather issue, he said.\n\nMany airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.\n\nOther things to consider:\n\nBook your flight with a credit card, Smith said: \u201cMany credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.\u201d\n\nConsider hunkering down at the airport rather than going to and from a hotel if your flight is delayed but not canceled. A lot depends on your personal comfort level and the estimated wait time, Keyes said.\n\nCheck whether there is a hotel room available within the airport.\n\nTry getting into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily, the Points Guy advises.\n\nMake safety your No. 1 priority. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous, Keyes warns.\n\nTravel insurance and receipts\n\nTalk to an expert about whether it's a good idea to purchase travel insurance. And research what kind of coverage you might get from your credit card, too. Poike/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nConsider buying travel insurance, advised Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel.\n\nIt said \u201cmost travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.\u201d\n\nThe site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.", "A \"Help Wanted\" sign is seen at a Golden Krust location on June 7 in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nLast week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023.\n\nAlso, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021.\n\nLuke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN he is closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment.\n\n\u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer \u2026 that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.\u201d\n\nStill, other measures of layoff activity haven\u2019t shown a worrisome spike.\n\nUS-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year\u2019s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nThe outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That\u2019s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year.", "CNN \u2014\n\n2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.\n\nEarlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line.

For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Nudist explains what you should definitely not do at a nude beach 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.\n\n\u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d\n\nWhile clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.\n\nDuring the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d\n\nChanneling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.\n\nOne of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.\n\nAnd their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year.

But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off.\n\nWith its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.\n\nWalk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.\n\nNida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania\n\nAgesta Beach, Sweden\n\nSweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.\n\nBased in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.\n\nOpen from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.\n\nAgesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand\n\nLittle Palm Beach is situated on Waiheke Island in New Zealand.

Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.\n\nL\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit.

After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.", "Editor\u2019s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.\n\nNathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.\n\nNathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office\n\nCruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.\n\nCNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.\n\nRamos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms \u2013 perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement\u2019s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.\n\nCruz\u2019s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.\n\nHis mother told investigators she was \u201cespecially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time\u201d and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.\n\nCruz\u2019s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he \u201cthreatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would \u2018shoot the school,\u2019\u201d according to the affidavit.\n\nThe mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle \u2013 the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Cruz \u201cdenied making any threats\u201d when interviewed by a detective, the document states.\n\nCNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.", "CNN \u2014\n\nHuman-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.\n\nScientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis.\n\nClimate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.\n\nIn the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels.\n\nHere\u2019s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.\n\nWhat happens to your body\n\nNormally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change \u2013 either lower or higher than that \u2013 it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University\u2019s school of medicine.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThe pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.\u201d\n\nThe second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.\n\nWhen you\u2019re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn\u2019t evaporate as easily \u2013 which pushes your body\u2019s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cThe higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,\u201d Linden said.\n\nHigh body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.\n\nTypes of heat-related illnesses\n\nMild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body\u2019s salt and moisture and can lead to muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.\n\nA heat rash can also develop. That\u2019s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases.\n\nWhen your body\u2019s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what\u2019s known as heat exhaustion.\n\n\u201cIn this case you\u2019re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You\u2019re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,\u201d Linden said.\n\n\u201cThis is the body\u2019s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.\u201d\n\nA heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where your body\u2019s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,\u201d Linden said.\n\nWarning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC.\n\nThe hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.\n\n\u201cSo when somebody\u2019s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that\u2019s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.\u201d\n\nWho is most at risk\n\nElderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.\n\nThe elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.\n\n\u201cVery young (people) as well, because they\u2019re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they\u2019re less likely to get out of the heat if they\u2019re starting to feel overheated,\u201d Linden said.\n\nStudent-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added.\n\n\u201cIn this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,\u201d Linden added.\n\nHow to stay safe\n\nWhen your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.\n\nFirst, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. \u201cIf somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThat means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.\u201d\n\nPutting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.\n\n\u201cIf you see anybody with any type of confusion, that\u2019s an immediate red flag,\u201d Linden added.\n\nWhen it\u2019s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities \u2013 especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.\n\nDon\u2019t wait until you\u2019re thirsty to drink water \u2013 as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water \u2013 or more \u2013 an hour.\n\n\u201cIf you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,\u201d Linden said.\n\nTry to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov. Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.\n\nWhen you\u2019re home, fans can help, but don\u2019t rely on them as your only way of cooling down \u2013 while it may feel more comfortable, they won\u2019t help prevent heat-related illness.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a super hot room, if you\u2019ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you\u2019ve got a fan, and you\u2019re able to mist yourself \u2026 then fans can be helpful,\u201d Linden said. \u201cFans are not foolproof.\u201d\n\nFinally, make sure you\u2019re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends \u2013 especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.", "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this story was initially published in June 2020.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOn this holiday you might see another red, white and blue flag flying over state capitols and city buildings.\n\nThat banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.\n\nThe flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation.

Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.\n\nFor more than two decades, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.\n\n\u201cThis country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,\u201d Haith said. \u201cIt (the idea for the design) just came through me.\u201d\n\nDesigning the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here\u2019s what each element of the flag represents.\n\nThe star\n\nThe white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.\n\nFor one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country\u2019s last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free.\n\nBut the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states.\n\nThe burst\n\nThe bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star.\n\nOn the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land.\n\nThe arc\n\nThe curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans.\n\nThe colors\n\nThe red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.\n\nJune 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law.\n\nAnd while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better \u2013 and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.", "Advocacy groups are petitioning Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to include extreme heat and wildfire smoke as major disasters in the same way they do for hurricanes and other major disasters and emergencies.\n\nExtreme heat is by far the most deadly kind of weather, killing on average more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to data tracked by the National Weather Service.\n\nBut as CNN as previously reported, FEMA\u2019s hands are tied by congress and the Stafford Act \u2014 the federal law that gives FEMA the power to respond to emergencies and determines what qualifies as one.\n\nThe 77-page petition, signed by 31 labor unions, public health organizations and environmental organizations, was sent to FEMA Monday proposing an amendment to the Stafford Act that would add extreme heat and wildfire smoke to the definition of major disasters.\n\n\u201cThis simple but elegant amendment serves to unlock critical funds for state, Tribal, and local governments and communities to manage and mitigate extreme heat and wildfire smoke\u2014both natural catastrophes predicted to worsen in duration, frequency, and severity due to the climate emergency,\u201d the petition says.\n\nThe petition notes that the Stafford Act can be easily amended as it was just a few years ago to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAround two dozen large wildfires are currently burning in the US, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, all of them in Western states. On the other side of the country, a dangerous, long-duration heat wave is tightening its grip on the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.

His successor has yet to be selected. Calhoun said he has a preferred candidate but he has not publicly identified that person and said the decision is up to the search committee and Boeing\u2019s board.\n\nAboulafia said the board has shown little indication of seeing a need to change the way things are done at Boeing, calling it a \u201cboard on autopilot.\u201d The board approved a $32.8 million pay package for Calhoun in 2023, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022.

Gazans say they have been bombed even when they evacuated to areas that were supposed to be safe \u2014 and that they have nowhere left to go. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles).\n\nIsraeli leadership criticizes the move: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard of the plan, according to an Israeli official.\n\nNetanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said this was unacceptable, until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue.

You had to stay at your hiring weight, which in my case was about 15 pounds less than my maximum limit.\n\n\u201cMy roommate got fired over this. The really terrible thing about it, other than what it did to women, is that this restriction was not removed until the 1990s.\u201d\n\nHood was one of 560 flight attendants, out of 14,000 applicants, hired in 1978 by TWA, then a major carrier, acquired by American Airlines in 2001.\n\nThe job started with a few days of intense training in Kansas City, where cadet flight attendants would learn everything from aircraft part names to emergency medical procedures, as well as the safety protocols of seven different aircraft. The list included the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of terrifying, because it was so big \u2013 and the stairs, the spiral stairs that led to first class that you had to go up and down not infrequently,\u201d says Hood. \u201cI would keep thinking: don\u2019t trip. Eventually I got used to it.\u201d\n\nCarving chateaubriand\n\nHood's favorite plane was a Lockheed L-1-11 TriStar. Christopher Deahr/Moment Editorial/Flickr Vision/Getty Images\n\nShe says her favorite plane to work on was the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. \u201cDomestically, only Eastern Airlines and TWA flew it. It was a very approachable, workable widebody plane with a lovely setup of two seats on each side and then four seats in the middle, so everybody could get out easily. Nobody was unhappy on that plane.\u201d\n\nFlying was still glamorous at the time, she says.\n\n\u201cPeople dressed up to fly and remembered the food in a good way. It\u2019s really different from today. I can only compare it to being in a fine hotel, or maybe on a cruise ship. Nothing was plastic and coach was super nice,\u201d says Hood, who remembers donning her Ralph Lauren-designed uniform and carving chateaubriand cooked to taste for first class passengers, who also had a choice of Russian caviar and lobster bisque to go with their Dom Perignon.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all a bed of roses. Smoking on board was widespread, and for flight attendants it was a nightmare.\n\n\u201cIf you went on a five-day trip, which wasn\u2019t uncommon, you had to pack a separate whole uniform because you just would smell so much like smoke,\u201d Hood says. \u201cBoy, was I glad when that stopped. The front rows of each section were deemed non-smoking, but the whole plane was filled with smoke because you couldn\u2019t keep it from going backwards, it was ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWhat about the Mile High Club? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t uncommon on international flights to see a man go into the bathroom and a minute later his seatmate join him, or some version of that,\u201d says Hood. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen on every flight, but you saw it.\n\n\u201cInternational flights usually weren\u2019t as full as they are now, so in those middle sections of five seats on a 747 you could see a couple put the armrests up, take a blanket and disappear under it. I can\u2019t say what they were doing, but it looked suspicious.\u201d\n\nAs for passengers flirting or asking flight attendants out, it was also common. \u201cI did date passengers, but that was mostly disastrous. It was never what I had imagined. But in 1982, I met a guy on a flight from San Francisco to New York. He was sitting in 47F \u2013 and I dated him for five years.\u201d\n\nAn empowering job\n\nHood left the job in 1986 to focus on her writing career. Ann Hood\n\nHood has seen her fair share of bizarre things on board. \u201cThe weirdest would definitely be the woman in first class who appeared to be breastfeeding her cat. I mean, I can\u2019t say that it was actually happening, but she had her cat to her breast.\n\n\u201cAnd then the guy who flew the whole way in his tighty-whities and his dress shirt and tie, because he didn\u2019t want to wrinkle his pants for a job interview. Or the guy on a 747 in Frankfurt who was riding his bicycle down the aisle,\u201d she reveals.\n\nThat said, the routine would sometimes kick in, and not every flight was a wondrous concentrate of adventure and glamor.\n\n\u201cI would say the job was 80% fun and 20% boring. In some flights, especially those that weren\u2019t very full, there was a lot of time to fill. You can only serve people so much food and so many drinks, and play so many movies. I made the job fun. I loved talking to people. I loved the feel of it. I still love flying today,\u201d says Hood.\n\nShe says it was indeed possible to actually visit and experience the cities she traveled to. \u201cSometimes your layover was really short or you were just tired, but for the most part, the city was right out the door. I very much took advantage of that when flying internationally.\u201d\n\nShe left the job to focus on her writing career in 1986, and by that time things had changed. Deregulation, which removed federal control over everything from fares to routes, had come fully into effect, changing flying forever.\n\nPlanes became filled with more seats and coach stopped being as pleasant, but flying was also democratized and made available to a far larger share of society.\n\nHood says she is proud of her career in the skies.\n\n\u201cFlight attendants are a force. They\u2019re highly unionized. They\u2019re independent. In the cabin, they make all the decisions. They have to troubleshoot. They\u2019re there for the emergency stuff. They land in cities where they don\u2019t know anything or anyone and find their way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an empowering job, yet it\u2019s a sexist job. In itself, it is as contradictory today as the time in which I started it,\u201d she says.\n\nNevertheless, she recommends it as a career option.\n\n\u201cI was 21 when I was hired, and it gave me confidence, it gave me poise, and the ability to think on my feet,\u201d she adds. \u201cTo take charge on that airplane, and once I got off, to walk into a city and feel completely at home \u2013 or at least figure out how to feel at home in it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it should be someone\u2019s life\u2019s work \u2013 if they want it to be that, great. But I think a few years working as a flight attendant could change your life.\u201d", "The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the protracted and bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBut a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group\u2019s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal \u2013 an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month \u2013 did not meet the group\u2019s demands for an end to the war.\n\nHamdan told CNN that Hamas needed \u201ca clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege \u2026 and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.\u201d\n\nNegotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified recently but appeared to grind to a halt Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it.\n\nRead more.", "Max, a recruitment officer for the DaVinci Wolves Battalion, talks with 39 year-old Mykhailo during his recruitment interview at a recruitment office on February 22, in Kyiv, Ukraine.

The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\n\nTogether, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\n\u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health.\n\nWhat happens in a medication abortion\n\nWhat happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nCNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?\n\nDr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.\n\nAn injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.\n\nThe aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.\n\nA medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.\n\nNausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.\n\nIn fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.\n\nThe level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.\n\nCNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?\n\nGrossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.\n\nSome people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.\n\nAnother successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.\n\nAnother study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription.\n\nPain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.\n\nCNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?\n\nGrossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.\n\nPeople who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization.\n\nIf a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill.\n\nAnyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful.\n\nPeople with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.\n\nCNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion?\n\nGrossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider.\n\nHeavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well.\n\nOne of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout.\n\nWe usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends.\n\nMost people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.\n\nIf someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician.\n\nPeople should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.", "A rocket is seen in the sky above northern Israel on June 12.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nA panel of 12 Delaware citizens is deliberating in the the federal gun trial against Hunter Biden.\n\nThis is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It\u2019s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\u201cGuns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that\u2019s the impetus behind these laws,\u201d Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \u201cThe evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter \u2026 but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\u201d\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president\u2019s son could face up to 25 years in prison.", "What is As Equals?\n\nThere is a gendered dimension to every one of our major global challenges including, but not limited to: climate change, economic or health inequality, the rise of authoritarianism, mass migration or algorithmic bias.

Do you study or follow a topic closely and can see what others have missed? Am I prepared to work with others? The best journalism is collaborative. You might have a great idea but not the right contacts or data skills, for example. If we commissioned you, would you be happy to work with a team to tell your story, if it needed it? How evergreen is my idea? While we will move quicker on columns, your opinion piece or feature idea shouldn't be irrelevant at the end of the day's news cycle. Is my story right for CNN?

Where does one end, and the other begin?\n\nThe key distinction appears to fall in the line between what Apple described as \u201cworld knowledge\u201d and \u201cpersonal context.\u201d Where Apple Intelligence will excel is combining information about you and your relationships and using those insights to streamline your everyday workflows \u2014 calling up old photos from an event or helping you create stylized AI-generated images of your contacts.

Apple said that while Apple Intelligence will understand a great deal about your personal life, other AI models \u2014 such as ChatGPT \u2014 may be better suited for responding to prompts related to more general information.\n\nAny prompts to ChatGPT will be sent to the platform on an opt-in basis \u2014 users will have to make a conscious decision to do so.
