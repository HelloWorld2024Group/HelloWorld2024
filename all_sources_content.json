At a meeting in Russia aimed at solidifying an anti-Western alliance, Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to Iran\u2019s first BRICS summit as a full member. He also made a show of Beijing\u2019s diplomatic and economic alliance with Tehran as conflict in the Middle East further escalates and Iran braces for Israel to retaliate against it for recent attacks.\n\n\u201cChina will unswervingly develop friendly cooperation with Iran,\u201d Xi told Pezeshkian, according to a Chinese government readout. Xi expressed his support for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, and the two leaders agreed to work together on \u201copposing hegemony and bullying.\u201d\n\nBut with violence threatening to bring the long-standing shadow war between Israel and Iran into the open, China is unlikely to force Iran to de-escalate, and the relationship between Beijing and Tehran is more restricted than it appears.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s relationship with Iran is strategically important, but also limited,\u201d says William Figueroa, a China-Iran expert at University of Groningen in the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not this new axis of evil that people portray China, Russia, and Iran to be. It\u2019s actually one of its lesser, more minor relationships in the Middle East, and I think that gets lost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEconomically isolated due to a strict international sanctions regime, Iran is dependent on commercial ties with China, its largest trading partner. That, together with their shared distrust of the United States, has contributed to stronger political ties.\n\nIran last year joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a political and economic organization established by China and Russia, with Beijing\u2019s encouragement, and was this week welcomed into BRICS with the help of Beijing. In February 2023, amid both countries\u2019 rising tensions with Washington, Pezeshkian\u2019s predecessor led a large delegation to Beijing in a high-profile state visit. It was the first by an Iranian president in 20 years.\n\nChina has taken advantage of the opportunity to buy oil cheaply from heavily sanctioned Iran, with oil exports from Iran to China increasing more than 25 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. Sales hit an all-time high this August, of 1.66 million barrels per day, according to data from Vortexa, an energy analytics firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the two countries\u2019 overall bilateral trade has diminished in the past decade and is dwarfed by China\u2019s trade with Iran\u2019s Gulf neighbors. Last year, for example, China\u2019s trade with Iran was only one-seventh of that with Saudi Arabia, according to Chinese trade data.\n\nIf Iran and Israel end up in direct conflict, China\u2019s oil supply from Iran could be disrupted.

It underscored Xi\u2019s ambitions to stake out a larger political presence in the Middle East.\n\nBut that Palestinian agreement has not amounted to anything, and even China\u2019s landmark Saudi-Iran deal reveals the limitations of its influence.\n\n\u201cChina didn\u2019t do much, basically,\u201d said Ahmed Aboudouh, an expert on Middle East-China relations at Chatham House policy institute in London. \u201cThe Iraqis and Omanis played a very important role for two years to bring these sides together, and China just came and put its great power stamp on the agreement and got the photo op.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s leverage over Iran remains minimal, analysts say, even as Chinese diplomats have been dispatched to confer with their Iranian counterparts.

They\u2019ve called over and over again for a cease-fire. The fact is just that it\u2019s not within their power to make any of those things happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXi this week doubled down on his rhetoric calling for peace in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAs the world enters a new period defined by turbulence and transformation, we are confronted with pivotal choices that will shape our future,\u201d he told the BRICS summit on Wednesday. \u201cShould we allow the world to descend into the abyss of disorder and chaos, or should we strive to steer it back on the path of peace and development?\u201d\n\nBut for Xi, being seen as striving toward this goal, particularly in the developing world, may be more important than successfully brokering peace.\n\nChinese leaders are not \u201cjudging success or failure based on whether they successfully mediated an end to the conflict,\u201d said Oriana Skylar Mastro, an expert on the Chinese military at Stanford University and author of \u201cUpstart: How China Became a Great Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are seeing it mainly as a lever and tool of global influence.

An NBC News poll from October found that women were supporting Harris by a 14-point margin, while men were supporting Trump by a 16-point margin. Polls from multiple major outlets also have showed that Harris and Trump are locked in an extremely tight race.\n\nObama also addressed voters who were considering not casting ballots or voting for Trump or a third-party candidate in protest, arguing that \"we as women will become collateral damage to your rage.\"\n\n\"Are you as men prepared to look into the eyes of the women and children you love and tell them that you supported this assault on our safety?\" she asked.\n\nHarris, who spoke after Obama, echoed similar sentiments, arguing that men saw the women they loved \"put at risk because their rights have been stripped away.\" Before speaking in Michigan on Saturday, Harris held an event in Texas on Friday, using the red-state setting to rally supporters against what she called a Trump-inflicted \"health care crisis.\"\n\n\"The men of America don\u2019t want this.

Trump says he supports states\u2019 rights to decide the legality of abortion procedures within their own borders, and he's said that he would not sign a federal ban.\n\nAs Obama emphasized potential dangers to women, Trump during his Saturday rallies invoked dark images of crime, criticized Beyonc\u00e9 campaigning with Harris and touted his foreign policy experience while claiming that Harris \u201cwants\u201d war.\n\n\"She\u2019d love a draft.

Were we talking about, say, Sally Vance, fellow Appalachian bootstrap-puller, there would be less confusion over what she has very clearly demonstrated through her relationship. For women, marriages are personal and political; they provide protection, but they also demand fealty. Vance, again and again, offers that loyalty, be it by her appearance at the Republican National Convention for a speech or by her silence when her idiot husband says he loves his wife, even though \u201cobviously she\u2019s not a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not as if she hasn\u2019t made some attempts to defend J.D. either, like her ham-fisted efforts to understand his now-notorious \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d comment. \u201cWhat he was really saying is that it can be really hard to be a parent in this country,\u201d she told Ainsley Earhardt in August.* This was absolutely not what he was really saying.

They\u2019re to her husband, and that\u2019s an agreement women have been making since the advent of the marriage license. For political wives, that deal is often even more explicit. Vance is opting for a less bombastic version of what first and second ladies have done, election after election. Her quietude does not make her enigmatic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public hope around Vance seems to be that she could soften her husband, that her position in a minority group could sway him toward a more moderate stance when it comes to abortion or immigration. But why does it feel more likely that Vance would push her husband to the left, and not that they would veer in the same direction, further right?

He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic\u2019s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nRepublican National Convention attendees hold signs that read \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d on the third day of the gathering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 17, 2024. Alex Wong / Getty Images\n\nThis spring, an eye-opening poll from Axios suggested what once seemed unthinkable: Four in 10 Democrats were open to the idea of the US government deporting undocumented immigrants en masse. Though that share of support might seem high, other polls conducted since have found something similar, suggesting Americans at large are open to harsher, more Trumpian immigration policies.\n\nAnd yet, as attention-grabbing as some of the headlines on support for mass deportations have been (and as former President Donald Trump and his allies continue to talk about his plans for such), those polls may not accurately capture the mood of the American electorate. Support for a policy of mass deportation, while superficially high, rests on two related complications: substantial confusion among voters about what it might actually entail, as well as a generalized desire to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 on immigration, which polls frequently report to be among Americans\u2019 top issues.\n\nThat disconnect is because standalone polls and headlines do very little to capture the complexity of many Americans\u2019 feelings about immigration, which often include simultaneous, and apparently contradictory, support for more immigrant-friendly policies alongside draconian ones. The real answer, more specific polling by firms like Pew Research Center suggests, lies somewhere in the middle: A good share of voters, it seems, are fine with increasing deportations. Some might even want the kind of operation Trump is floating. But many also want exceptions and protections for specific groups of immigrants who have been living in the US for a while, or have other ties to the country.\n\nTaking a deeper look at polling on immigration\n\nBack in August, the Pew Research Center dug into the question of mass deportations by asking registered voters their opinions on immigration levels, the value of immigrants, and what kind of exceptions they might endorse to allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the US.\n\nThe results were messy, but showed two distinct things.\n\nFirst, support for \u201cmass deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally\u201d received majority support: 56 percent of registered voters \u201cstrongly or somewhat\u201d favored such a proposal. That majority of voters included, unsurprisingly, 88 percent of Trump voters; it also included about 3 in 10 supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe August findings align with Pew\u2019s earlier research, conducted in January 2024, which found a majority of Americans think \u201cincreasing deportations\u201d of people who are living in the US illegally would improve the US immigration system and reduce southern border crossings. Republican respondents in that survey were essentially uniform in supporting such a policy; Democrats were divided, with similar shares (about 30 percent) saying deportations would make things better or worse.\n\nAt the same time, both of Pew\u2019s surveys found Americans were also supportive of more friendly policies for undocumented immigrants, like a pathway to citizenship. The August report notes that about 6 in 10 registered voters say that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to \u201cstay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met.\u201d And a similar share, 58 percent, favored \u201callowing undocumented immigrants to legally work and stay in the country if they are married to a US citizen.\u201d\n\nSahana Mukherjee, one of the Pew Research Center authors behind the August deep-dive on \u201cmass deportations,\u201d told me that as many as 40 percent of registered voters who support mass deportations also support a policy that would allow undocumented spouses of US citizens to remain in the country.\n\nThat share varies based on which candidate these voters support: About a third of Trump supporters who back mass deportations support such a plan, while about 60 percent of Harris supporters who back mass deportations do. But this group of voters with overlapping priorities suggests that when taking the temperature of the public, being open to mass deportations isn\u2019t the same as supporting a specific policy. Support changes when you get into the details of who could be affected.\n\nSimilarly, Mukherjee said, about 40 percent of registered voters who support mass deportations \u2014 one-third of the Trump supporters who do so, and two-thirds among the same pool of Harris supporters \u2014 also endorse the idea of undocumented immigrants being allowed to remain in the US \u201cif certain conditions are met.\u201d\n\nOther high-quality polls second these nuanced, seemingly contradictory feelings: A September Ipsos poll found 54 percent of American adults supported a mass deportation plan, while, at the same time, 68 percent would also support a \u201cpathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children.\u201d\n\nSimilar dynamics hold true among Hispanic and Latino respondents, with a twist: While about 4 in 10 Latinos in the two most recent high-quality polls of these voters backed some kind of deportation program, a much higher share also supported some kind of pathway to citizenship.\n\nA New York Times-Siena poll of Hispanics from October, for example, found 67 percent of Hispanics backed a pathway to citizenship for \u201call undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States\u201d while 45 percent supported deporting immigrants living illegally in the US. A poll from NBC/Telemundo in September showed similar levels of support for deportations, while 87 percent of Hispanics backed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought as children to the US, and 91 percent supported that pathway for undocumented spouses.\n\nMaking sense of these policy nuances\n\nSo why do voters hold seemingly conflicting views on immigration? Pro-immigrant advocates argue that there isn\u2019t a contradiction here \u2014 those competing numbers instead represent people who don\u2019t understand exactly what \u201cmass deportation\u201d means or what a deportation program would look like in practice.\n\nAmericans might not understand that deportations of all undocumented immigrants would include deportations of DACA recipients and longtime neighbors or friends who have been living normally and are bedrocks of local communities, advocates and researchers say \u2014 rather than only recent arrivals, or those few migrants who commit violent crimes yet get outsize media and political attention, who they may view differently.\n\nMukherjee said there\u2019s also a degree of nuance that issue and horserace polls might not be picking up, since they aren\u2019t necessarily equipped to ask in-depth questions.\n\n\u201cWe asked about one requirement specifically in the survey, which is looking at if you\u2019re married to a US citizen, but it remains to be seen whether there are other requirements that people are also thinking about,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cWhat we hear about in everyday discourse, in the media, is if you have a child who is US born, or if you yourself came as a child. We didn\u2019t get into this in the survey, but it\u2019s possible these are some of the requirements people were thinking about, and perhaps that could be influencing that share of people who support both.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, when it comes to complex policy options, and especially to immigration policy, Americans can be idiosyncratic in their opinions. Surveys that don\u2019t specify what \u201cmass deportation\u201d means may also be tracking inflated support for the kind of hardline stance the Trump/Vance campaign is offering, Steven Kull, the director of the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, told me.\n\n\u201cQuestions that are just like, \u2018do you favor or oppose mass deportation\u2019 I think are very limited in their value, because you don\u2019t know what it means,\u201d Kull said. \u201cAll people know is \u2018deport a large number of people.\u2019 And 1,000 people is a lot of people. Ten thousand is a lot of people. It\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s 11 million \u2014 that the policy is to deport 11 million \u2014 and that it would entail a massive operation, and all that has to be clear to really understand what public opinion is on the issue.\u201d\n\nKull\u2019s team instead has run surveys of national samples and groups of swing-state voters that provide additional information and arguments in favor and against either mass deportations or pathways to citizenship. The result, again, is complex, but support for mass deportations falls when presented against the option for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants provided they meet specific requirements.\n\n\u201cThere is some appeal to the idea [of mass deportation] \u2014 let\u2019s be clear about that. But it\u2019s not that people have it all crystallized in their mind,\u201d Kull said.\n\nHow is this playing out on the campaign trail?\n\nImmigration reform advocates and some Democratic strategists are doing their best to highlight that nuance when advising Democrats on how to respond to Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric around immigration and immigrants. They urge Democrats to be clear about just who would get caught up in a broad mass deportation scheme \u2014 and to contrast that with a more \u201cbalanced\u201d Democratic approach to immigration and the border.\n\nIn a private memo prepared for national Democratic campaigns looking to address Trump\u2019s mass deportation position and shared with Vox, strategists argue that this polling picture presents Democrats with a narrow path to repudiate the Trump approach while acknowledging the real concerns some voters have with recent waves on migration in the Biden years.\n\n\u201cWe have more than enough reason to believe that voters, when asked their opinion on deportations, take it to mean the deportation of people who have recently crossed the border, as well as known criminal elements,\u201d the strategists advise. They highlight Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance\u2019s October debate statement explaining this deportation scheme (emphasis original to the memo):\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Vance position as stated here is likely popular,\u201d the strategists explain. \u201cThat is why Harris and Democrats cannot allow him to frame his position in that way, especially when we know their actual plans call for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants (including spouses and Dreamers).\u201d\n\nComplex feelings on immigration and potential deportation programs offer Democrats an opportunity to stake out more moderate ground when discussing immigration policy \u2014 and to prevent immigration opponents from defining the terms of the debate over policy. They\u2019re also an important reminder that it can be perilous to trust top-line numbers and polling results without digging into the details, or presenting voters with more options to begin with. Recent polls all show a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, yes, but they also show that there is room for pro-immigrant candidates to shape the national debate and make a vocal case for Americans and immigrants."}, "salon": {"content": "The first time Steven signed up to inject his penis with filler in 2019, he was afraid he would permanently mutilate it. There wasn\u2019t a lot of reliable information about the procedure online, and he had come across a few horror stories about doctors injecting silicone into penises, causing their patients to lose sensation.\n\nStill, he had wanted his penis to be bigger for years and was finally approved for a circumcision in Canada, where he lives. This, he had read, reduced some of the risks associated with the penile filler procedure, in which a solution \u2014 anything from silicone to hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural substance found in the eyes and joints \u2014 is injected into the penis to adjust its girth and shape. With few options nearby at the time, he booked a flight to Mexico, where he had found a clinic that seemed to be reliable.\n\n\u201cI remember sitting on a plane \u2026 and being absolutely terrified \u2014 like, is this going to be a nightmare experience that\u2019s going to ruin my life?\u201d Steven, who is using a pseudonym to protect his privacy, told Salon in a phone interview. \u201cYou get scared.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not a central database that tracks the number of these procedures done, but the rise in penile augmentation in recent years has been described as a \u201cboom,\u201d and doctors interviewed for this story said they have been seeing a rise in the demand for it.\n\n\"You name it and someone has put it in their penis, or tried to.\"\n\nBesides HA, doctors have injected several products into the penis. Permanent fillers like silicone or paraffin have been used but are not recommended, as they have been associated with long-term complications like necrosis and deformities. Other semi-permanent solutions like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres or fats are often used as well, although they can also cause lumps that may be harder to remove than less permanent solutions like HA.\n\n\u201cYou name it and someone has put it in their penis, or tried to,\u201d said Dr. Amy Pearlman, a urologist at the Prime Institute. \u201cPeople are talking about [penile augmentation] and certainly a lot of patients are asking providers about it.\u201d\n\nIn the research that has been published on these procedures, several studies show the risks are relatively low for injecting HA, which can be dissolved. However, the more permanent the filler, the higher the risk for complications and the lower the chances of being able to get it fixed, Pearlman said. Without clear guidelines on the procedure, many doctors are left to figure out best practices on their own, although Pearlman argued the evidence for using HA for penile augmentation was relatively solid at this point.\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

In a 2016 study of 729 of his patients, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, three patients had to have a nodule PMMA filler removed surgically, and about half of some 200 patients who responded to a questionnaire said they felt they were left with irregularities in their penis.\n\n\u201cThe main complication that we face is irregularities,\u201d Cassavantis told Salon in a phone interview. \u201cJust a few of them, especially when they are uncircumcised, developed a serious deformity, but that was not only related to the lack of circumcision but also to the skills of the injector.\u201d\n\n\"Most of my guys say it\u2019s very addictive and they keep coming back to top it off.\"\n\nSteven\u2019s procedure was performed with PMMA in Mexico, where he had volunteered to be one of the first patients of a new practitioner training to do the procedure. He didn\u2019t experience medical complications from the experience, but he wasn\u2019t entirely pleased with how his penis looked afterward. A few years later, the procedures had gotten more popular and he found a doctor closer to home offering HA injections. Again, he opted to have a procedure done. Since his first visit with the new doctor in mid-2022, he has returned about a half-dozen times to get re-upped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that if I\u2019d gone down [to Mexico] for probably another one to two sessions, I would have been happy with the aesthetics overall,\u201d Steven said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad, it just wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d\n\nWhen people first started doing these procedures around the '80s and \u201890s, many people who weren\u2019t medical professionals were performing penile injections using baby oils, silicone and paraffin, Cassavantis said. As the years went by, doctors started offering less permanent penile augmentation options and best practices were shared to reduce the risk of complications, he said.\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\n\u201cThings are getting better and people are more open to talk about it, but in the early years, this was a procedure that was kind of dark,\u201d Cassavantis said. \u201cThe number of complications that we saw in the early years were really bad.\u201d\n\nWhat drives most men to try penile augmentation is similar to what drives people to get any other cosmetic procedure done: They are unhappy with a part of their body and want to change or enhance it. In a survey of men who got the procedure, the most common reason they did it was to improve self-confidence, followed by wanting to increase sexual function.\n\nSocial media and its proliferation of unrealistic beauty standards have been shown to impact the mental health and self-esteem of girls and young women. Of course, these standards affect everyone\u2019s perceptions of body image and self-esteem \u2014 including men.\n\nResearch suggests around half of men are unhappy with their penis size. Some studies have identified a form of body dysmorphia called penile dysmorphic disorder that causes long-term anxiety in a small fraction of men, though this is not a diagnosis that has been separated out from body dysmorphia disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).\n\n\u201cIf the first thing someone does in the morning is go to the bathroom and pee, that\u2019s the first thing they see to start their day, and they\u2019re unhappy with that part of their body, it\u2019s going to impact their mental state throughout the day,\u201d Pearlman said.\n\nMany men looking to change their penis size through these procedures also have to pay a steep price. Because it\u2019s an elective procedure, it usually costs thousands of dollars per session out of pocket. How long the temporary fillers last depends on a number of factors, like level of sexual activity, said Dr. John Leonardo, an anesthesiologist who performs the procedures. He uses a hybrid product that combines HA with Radiesse, a cosmetic filler. It\u2019s common for patients to come back to re-up their filler before it has naturally broken down, he added.\n\n\u201cMost of my guys say it\u2019s very addictive and they keep coming back to top it off,\u201d Leonardo told Salon in a phone interview.\n\nSome medical organizations have addressed penile augmentation as the demand for it continues to increase but don\u2019t provide best practices for what is still considered an \u201cexperimental\u201d procedure. The American Urological Association issued a position statement on fat injections for penile augmentation, indicating that there is not enough evidence to suggest the procedure is safe or effective. In April, the Sexual Medicine Society of North America released a position statement concluding that there wasn\u2019t enough accurate research conducted in penile augmentation to make recommendations, although it did recommend against permanent injections like silicone.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, without accurate information, it is not possible for clinicians or patients to make an appropriate judgment as to the true risks and benefits of a therapy,\u201d it states. \u201cAs such, informed consent is limited, which contributes to the recommendation that some of the therapies be considered experimental at the present time.\u201d\n\nSome have called for the development of national guidelines to ensure the procedure, which is increasing in prevalence, is performed safely. In one letter to the editor published in the journal Urology, a urology resident likened the lack of knowledge surrounding penile augmentation in the specialty to \u201ca plastic surgeon [being] unfamiliar with a \u2018Brazilian Butt Lift.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithout said guidelines, providers who want to perform these procedures are left to seek training on their own, Pearlman explained. Plus, there are no products that are approved for this use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although it\u2019s common for doctors to use things off-label, it could improve the safety of the procedure to have a product specifically designed for penile augmentation.\n\n\u201cEven though a lot of people would consider the urologist to be the expert in the penis, we don\u2019t really have much dedicated to the cosmetic aspect of that,\u201d Pearlman said.\n\nRegardless, men are electing to have these cosmetic procedures to increase the size of their penises.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of a taboo subject, and it's not something that anybody talks about,\u201d Steven said. \u201cI feel like it would be better if there were more information out there for guys.\u201d"}, "theintercept": {"content": "Rep.

It\u2019s unclear why he is so interested in NSO Group, the infamous Israeli spyware firm that was blacklisted by the U.S. for its role in human rights abuses.\n\nBetween February and July, though, Sessions and his team met eight times with lobbyists on behalf of NSO.\n\nOne meeting was held for a \u201cbriefing on Bureau of Industry and Security Status\u201d \u2014 the Department of Commerce office that blacklisted NSO in November 2021. Others were for \u201cdiscussions of news articles reporting on NSO technology and the war in Gaza\u201d and \u201cNSO VISA issue,\u201d according to documents filed with the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, or FARA, at the end of August.\n\nIn July, on the same day that the lobbyists from the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a D.C. powerhouse, met with Sessions to \u201cdiscuss NSO technology and human rights policies,\u201d one of its lawyers and former House member from Texas, Greg Laughlin, paid $1,000 by check to \u201cPete Sessions for Congress.\u201d At other times, Laughlin \u2014 who is actively registered as a lobbyist for NSO, according to current filings \u2014 donated to the campaigns of other Texas Republicans who NSO met with, including Rep. Dan Crenshaw.\n\n\u201cThis absolutely looks like part of NSO Group lobbyists ongoing efforts to reverse the firm\u2019s blacklisting.\u201d\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Israel\u2019s war efforts and the looming possibility of a Trump administration, NSO is doubling down on its efforts to connect with members of Congress \u2014 almost exclusively with Republicans \u2014 as it makes a bid to reverse its blacklisting. NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware can infect and infiltrate cellphones and has been used by authoritarian governments to hack the devices of dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists, enabling grave abuses.\n\nThe latest blitz in its yearslong campaign for delisting kicked off at the onset of the Israeli war in Gaza last year, when NSO tried to persuade Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that its technology was of use to the American government.\n\n\u201cIt is, unfortunately, not uncommon for FARA registrants to make campaign contributions to the members of Congress they\u2019re contacting on behalf of foreign interests,\u201d Ben Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy program at the Quincy Institute, told The Intercept. \u201cAnd, even if that contribution occurs on the exact same day the meeting takes place, it\u2019s perfectly legal.\u201d\n\nFreeman said NSO\u2019s focus on Republicans might arise from Democrats\u2019 growing disillusionment with Israel.\n\n\u201cThis absolutely looks like part of NSO Group lobbyists ongoing efforts to reverse the firm\u2019s blacklisting,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, they\u2019re going to find Republicans an easier target than Democrats for putting pressure on the Commerce Department to delist NSO Group, with many Democrats\u2019 souring on Israel because of the thousands of civilians they\u2019ve killed in the Gaza war.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Sessions spokesperson Matt Myams said, \u201cFormer Congressman Greg Laughlin has known and politically supported Congressman Sessions for many years. During that time, they have discussed a wide variety of topics, including general questions about how certain immigration laws work.\u201d (NSO Group declined to comment.)\n\nSo far this year NSO has spent over $1.8 million on lobbying, according to FARA documents. Alongside Pillsbury, D.C.-based Chartwell Strategy Group as well as Los Angeles lobbying firm Paul Hastings have also heavily focused their efforts on connecting predominately with Republican lawmakers on behalf of NSO.\n\nWhile NSO continues to rebuild its reputation in the U.S., others have thrown in the towel. Candiru, another Israeli spyware company which was blacklisted along with NSO, lost its U.S. contracts and terminated its Washington lobbying contract with ArentFox Schiff earlier this year.\n\nNSO, in contrast, continued its effort by using Israel\u2019s war to boost its chances. The company marketed itself as a volunteer in the war on Gaza, claiming to help track down missing Israelis and hostages. The bid to persuade the American government to let it come back to the table has been called an attempt to \u201ccrisis-wash\u201d NSO\u2019s record.\n\nNSO in Court\n\nEven as it makes the case in Washington that it complies with U.S. requirements for discouraging rights abuses using its software, in California, NSO is being accused in a separate instance of flagrantly defying a federal court order.\n\nEarlier this month, WhatsApp and its parent company Meta asked the judge in their case against NSO to award them a total win as punishment for NSO\u2019s violations of discovery requirements. The spyware company has refused to produce internal email communications and the source code of its technology.\n\nIn NSO\u2019s response, filed on October 16, the firm said there was \u201cno basis for any sanction, let alone terminating sanctions, because Defendants have not violated any order.\u201d WhatsApp\u2019s termination request, the filing said, was \u201cludicrous.\u201d NSO said WhatsApp\u2019s case was \u201cthe first of five ill-conceived lawsuits filed against Defendants in the United States amidst a wave of negative press coverage.\u201d\n\nIn its five-year-long case, WhatsApp this month made sweeping allegations about NSO\u2019s refusal to produce internal email communications and Pegasus source code.\n\n\u201cNSO\u2019s discovery violations were willful, and unfairly skew the record on virtually every key issue in the case, from the merits, to jurisdiction, to damages, making a full and fair trial on the facts impossible,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\nLast year, NSO asked the court for a protective order to insulate them from the discovery process under Israeli law, which was denied. At a hearing this February, the court said it \u201cwould not feel reluctant to impose sanctions\u201d if NSO failed to meet its discovery obligations.\n\n\u201cNSO group has made a lot of arguments to resist discovery and kind of draw out the early stages of litigation in these cases as much as possible,\u201d said Stephanie Krent, attorney at Columbia University\u2019s Knight First Amendment Institute.\n\nThe next hearing in the WhatsApp case will take place on November 7.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on protecting our users,\u201d a WhatsApp spokesperson told The Intercept. \u201cWe firmly believe NSO\u2019s operations violate U.S. law and they must be held accountable for their unlawful attacks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to the case by WhatsApp, NSO is facing other hefty accusations in U.S. litigation.\n\nLast month, Apple asked a court in San Francisco to dismiss its three-year hacking suit against NSO. The California tech giant said its case was no longer viable after Israeli government officials took files from NSO\u2019s headquarters in an apparent attempt to frustrate lawsuits in the U.S. Apple argued it may now never be able to get the most critical files about Pegasus spyware.\n\nU.K. Case\n\nAs NSO continues to face problems in the U.S., the High Court in London ruled this month that a case against Saudi Arabia for its use of Pegasus can move forward, according to documents obtained by The Intercept. (The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe ruling came after four human rights defenders who were hacked with Pegasus on British soil submitted a report to the Metropolitan Police last month asking them to open an investigation and prosecute the company.\n\nYahya Assiri, a Saudi human rights activist who has been granted refugee status in the U.K., had previously lodged a civil claim against Saudi Arabia. As a check to protect diplomatic relations, British courts have a process to approve the routing of claims to foreign governments.\n\n\u201cViolators\u2019 impunity is the main power for repression to continue.\u201d\n\nWith this month\u2019s ruling, Assiri has overcome that hurdle. His lawyers can now serve his claim against Saudi Arabia for using NSO\u2019s Pegasus and another spyware product by Quadream \u2014 also an Israeli company founded by NSO veterans \u2014 to hack his phone multiple times between 2018 and 2020 while he was living in the U.K.\n\nThe claim will be sent through diplomatic channels to the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cViolators\u2019 impunity is the main power for repression to continue. Accountability \u2014 bringing them before courts, the media, and the world \u2014 can at least partially deter them,\u201d Assiri told The Intercept. \u201cThe evidence is strong, and the authorities\u2019 request for immunity has been rejected. This means that the world must stop looking for justifications for violations \u2014 there is no justification for any violation.\u201d"}, "theatlantic": {"content": "The prevalence of positive illusions is one of the most well-established findings in psychology. Most people have an exaggerated view of their own abilities and expect that more good things\u2014and fewer bad things\u2014will happen to them than is likely.\n\nDespite being unrealistic, such beliefs have benefits: Overly positive people are happier, cope better with adversity, and think they have more control over their life. Believing that things are a little better than they actually are may be necessary for robust mental health.\n\nIn a similar way, many citizens hold overly positive, but possibly necessary, beliefs about their country. A sense of national pride can foster community and bring people together, and it\u2019s often a sign of a thriving democracy. In the United States, one source of patriotism is American exceptionalism\u2014the idea that the U.S. is a unique, and uniquely superior, nation. With its origin as a democracy in a world of kingdoms and its emphasis on freedom and opportunity, this narrative goes, the American system is out of the ordinary.\n\nAmong the young, that belief is rapidly dying. Since 1976, a large nationally representative survey has asked U.S. high-school seniors, 17 and 18 years old, whether they agree that \u201cDespite its many faults, our system of doing things is still the best in the world\u201d: a fairly succinct summary of American exceptionalism. In the early 1980s, 67 percent of high-school seniors agreed that the U.S. system was the best. By 2022, only 27 percent did. Thus, only one out of four American teens now agrees that their country is exceptional.\n\nRead: 20-somethings are in trouble\n\nThe decline appears to be mostly untethered to national events. Belief in American exceptionalism went down during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, and also during the economically prosperous years of the 2010s. It declined when the U.S. was at war and also when it was at peace. It declined as income inequality grew rapidly, from 1980 to 2000, and also as inequality moderated after 2000.\n\nSupport for the idea is now particularly unpopular among liberal teens. As recently as the late 1990s, a majority had agreed that the U.S. system was the best. By 2021\u201322, that had shrunk to 14 percent\u2014only one out of seven. (Belief in American exceptionalism has declined among conservative teens as well, but much less so: 47 percent of conservative teens believed in the idea in 2021\u201322.)\n\nEven the belief that the founding of the United States was a positive development seems to be on the way out: A recent poll conducted by the Democracy Fund asked Americans if the Founders are \u201cbetter described as villains\u201d or \u201cas heroes.\u201d Four out of 10 Gen Zers chose \u201cvillains,\u201d compared with only one in 10 Boomers. If your country\u2019s Founders are the bad guys instead of the good guys, it becomes much harder to believe that its system is the best in the world\u2014or even worth defending. (Ideas about America are hardly the only beliefs that have bent toward pessimism among American youth in the past two decades. In early 2002, for instance, 23 percent of high-school seniors agreed with the statement \u201cWhen I think about all the terrible things that have been happening, it is hard for me to hold out much hope for the world.\u201d In early 2019, 40 percent agreed.)\n\nDour views of the nation\u2019s status and possibilities may shape its future. Gen Z may be disillusioned, but it is not, by and large, nihilistic: Today\u2019s young adults are also more interested in taking action than previous generations. From 2014 to 2021\u201322, an increasing number of high-school seniors agreed that protesting and voting could have \u201ca major impact on how things are run in this country.\u201d Voter turnout among young adults has been higher among Gen Z than previous generations at the same age, and political protests appear to have become more frequent in the eight or so years since Gen Z arrived on college campuses.\n\nThat, of course, could yield positive changes. One of the most important American ideals, arguably, is that the American project is unfinished, and that society can be made better, generation by generation. Throughout U.S. history, discontent and even righteous anger have often been important correctives to overly broad or unthinking sentiments about the country\u2019s goodness, which, when unchallenged, can perpetuate injustices.\n\nBut many of Gen Z\u2019s members seem convinced that radical change is necessary\u2014to the model of government, to the economy, to the culture. In a 2020 poll I analyzed for my book Generations, three out of four American Gen Zers\u2014more than any other generation\u2014agreed that \u201csignificant changes\u201d were needed to the government\u2019s \u201cfundamental design and structure.\u201d Nearly two-thirds believed that America was not \u201ca fair society,\u201d again a higher rate than older adults. In a 2018 Gallup poll, more 18-to-29-year-olds had a positive view of socialism (51 percent) than of capitalism (45 percent). Some of the ideals, and idealism, that were commonly accepted in previous generations seem to have a looser hold over young adults today.\n\nWhy has Gen Z turned so definitively toward disillusionment and away from seeing their country as superior?\n\nOne reason may be their mental health: Twice as many teens and young adults are depressed than in the early 2010s. This is a tragedy\u2014and it\u2019s likely to have wide-reaching effects. Depression isn\u2019t just about emotions; it\u2019s also about cognition. By definition, depressed people see the world in a more negative light. They are less likely to see the positive, including in their country. Increases in depression are larger among liberals, consistent with the larger decline in their belief in American exceptionalism.\n\nChanges in news consumption may also play a part. When newspapers were read on paper, all of the news\u2014positive and negative\u2014was printed together. Now negative news is king. Negative articles are almost twice as likely to be shared on social media as positive articles. Social-media algorithms push angry and divisive content. With Gen Z getting most of its information online, it is viewing the country through a negatively skewed funhouse mirror.\n\nA third reason may lie in the shifts in high-school American-history curricula. Some\u2014typically liberal\u2014states now spend more time than they once did on the more deplorable facts of the nation\u2019s history, such as the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the massacre of Native Americans, and the Founders\u2019 ownership of slaves. That coverage lays out facts students need to know, but, especially if these events are emphasized more than the country\u2019s more noble endeavors, it may also undermine feelings of national pride.\n\nRead: Are Gen Z men and women really drifting apart?\n\nFinally, Gen Z\u2019s facility with social media may itself be coloring the generation\u2019s views. Gen Z has learned that making a problem look as big and awful as possible is a highly effective way of getting traction on social media. Many problems are often portrayed as profound and systemic, fixable only by fundamental rethinks and institutional purges. It makes everything seem worse than it is.\n\nMy worry, as a social psychologist who has studied all of the living American generations, is that these various forces\u2014and the pessimism they have generated \u2014could move Gen Z to change systems that are not necessarily broken. That\u2019s especially relevant as this generation comes of age and rises toward political power. Despite the common perception that the system is \u201crigged\u201d and young people will never attain the wealth Boomers did, for instance, the Federal Reserve of St. Louis recently found that Millennial and Gen Z young adults actually have 25 percent more wealth than Boomers did at the same age. Inflation-adjusted median incomes for American young adults are at all-time highs, and poverty rates for children and younger adults are lower than they were in the early 2000s. The social-media-driven negativity machine may have prevented Gen Z\u2014and all of us\u2014from seeing the good news.\n\nJust as the positive views we have about our individual selves may be exaggerated, the idea that the United States is uniquely superior is also, at least in part, an overly optimistic illusion we tell ourselves as a country. But like our positive self-illusions, patriotism also has its benefits, including a more satisfied citizenry and more political stability. With Gen Z unconvinced of the country\u2019s exceptionalism and willing to take action, the U.S. may, in the coming decades, witness an era of extraordinary political change."}, "thenewyorker": {"content": "In the middle of the nineteenth century, filth of every kind accumulated on the streets of New York. The land was boggy and lacked proper drainage. Epidemics ravaged many of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods. In the summer of 1864, an inspection undertaken by a committee of concerned physicians yielded a seventeen-volume report that catalogued the conditions. One inspector noted that, in his assigned district, refuse filled gutters, blocked sewage culverts, and sent forth \u201cperennial emanations which generate pestiferous disease.\u201d Another observed that certain streets better resembled \u201cdung-hills rather than the thoroughfares in a civilized city.\u201d In response to the report, state lawmakers introduced legislation that led to the establishment, in 1866, of the Metropolitan Board of Health, one of the country\u2019s first municipal public-health authorities. Upon its formation, the board immediately confronted a potential cholera outbreak. It established quarantine measures and administered new health ordinances that helped to contain the spread of the disease. Support for the new agency soared, and other cities began organizing similar authorities. The modern-day public-health movement in the United States was born.\n\nThe New Yorker Festival Presents \u201cOn the Trail\u201d Campaign reporters share stories from the front lines of a history-making Presidential race. Get tickets \u00bb\n\nAn important revelation from the \u201cgreat sanitary awakening\u201d of the nineteenth century, as it became known, was that social and environmental factors could significantly affect people\u2019s health. During the second half of the twentieth century, policymakers began turning their attention to issues such as product and workplace safety as a way to save lives. In the mid-nineteen-fifties, nearly forty thousand people were dying every year from motor-vehicle accidents. Attention was primarily focussed on the responsibility of drivers, but physicians and engineers pointed out that most of these deaths were, in fact, preventable through changes in automobile design. In 1965, Ralph Nader, a young lawyer who later became an activist and a perpetual Presidential candidate, published \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed,\u201d a book examining the ways in which automakers had failed to prioritize safety. It became an unlikely nonfiction best-seller, alongside Truman Capote\u2019s \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d Nader\u2019s reporting prompted congressional hearings and the formation of what is now known as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. William Haddon, a pioneering public-health scientist, became the agency\u2019s first administrator and oversaw the first safety requirements for new cars, including energy-absorbing steering columns, shoulder harnesses, and side-door beams. The ratio of motor-vehicle deaths to miles travelled by drivers in the United States plummeted.\n\nThe principal aim of public health is prevention. It takes its scientific cues primarily from epidemiology, which studies the prevalence of diseases and their determinants to shape control strategies. In the mid-nineteen-sixties, public-health practitioners began to incorporate these methods into a nascent discipline known as injury science, taking on problems such as children falling from windows, residential fires, childhood drug poisonings, and, beginning in earnest in the nineteen-nineties, gun violence. The premise is tantalizingly straightforward: utilize scientific data to identify risk factors and the most vulnerable populations, and adopt multipronged solutions to stop problems before they arise. When it comes to gun deaths, for instance, public-health interventions might include pediatricians inquiring about safe storage at home, and the government establishing waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and raising the legal age for gun ownership. The challenge comes in marshalling consensus for the kind of community-wide solutions that public health demands. This is where public-health initiatives have often floundered, including with guns.\n\nIn recent years, public-health researchers have begun to consider whether a new societal threat deserves their scrutiny: political violence. One of the researchers leading this effort is Garen Wintemute, the director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis, who has spent more than four decades studying firearm violence. Wintemute is a gaunt, bespectacled emergency physician. (He still works four or five weekend shifts a month at U.C. Davis\u2019s hospital.) He is seventy-two years old but speaks with an almost childlike inquisitiveness when discussing research into violent death. Wintemute told me that, during the coronavirus pandemic, he and his researchers tracked a nationwide surge in firearms purchases, particularly among first-time gun owners. Even as the COVID-19 crisis began to subside in 2021, they noticed that people were still purchasing guns at unusually high rates. Baffled by the ongoing demand, he wondered, What the hell is this? He spent a week immersing himself in the available data on political polarization and its connection to violence. When he emerged, he concluded that the subject of political violence urgently needed study, because people seemed to be \u201carming up\u201d and the result \u201ccould reshape the future of the country.\u201d He eventually directed a third of his thirty-person team to spend at least some of their time on a new project: researching the possibility that people might resort to violence to achieve their political ends.\n\nAs with any public-health problem, the first task was to collect reliable data. Wintemute\u2019s team conducted their first broad-based survey in 2022 and found that nearly a third of the population believed that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least one of seventeen political objectives\u2014a list that included curbing voter fraud, stopping illegal immigration, and returning Donald Trump to the Presidency. Nearly one in five agreed strongly or very strongly with the statement that \u201chaving a strong leader for America is more important than having a democracy.\u201d The willingness to justify violence was greater among people who identified as \u201cstrong Republicans\u201d than those who identified as \u201cstrong Democrats.\u201d Another study by Wintemute\u2019s team found that nearly half of a cohort that they labelled \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d\u2014self-identified Republicans who voted for Trump in 2020 and believed the election was stolen\u2014strongly or very strongly agreed with the statement \u201cOur American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d Wintemute also examined the threat posed by right-wing extremists who endorse racist beliefs and the use of violence to effect social change, and who express approval of certain militia groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Within this small subset\u2014Wintemute estimates it to be less than two per cent of the population\u2014he found strong association with support for political violence and the willingness to engage in such violence.\n\nYet certain findings offered Wintemute reason for optimism. A survey published last month found that only 6.5 per cent of the population believes strongly or very strongly that a civil war is coming, and just 3.6 per cent that the \u201cUnited States needs a civil war to set things right.\u201d Both figures are roughly similar to the previous year\u2019s findings, an unexpected result, given that 2024 is a Presidential-election year and political tensions have ratcheted upward. Wintemute also found that, of the 3.7 per cent of respondents who said they considered it very or extremely likely they\u2019d participate as a combatant in a large-scale conflict, more than forty-four per cent said they would be \u201cnot likely\u201d to join if they were dissuaded by family members; more than thirty per cent said they could be deterred if a respected religious leader urged them not to participate; and just under a quarter said they could be dissuaded by a respected news or social-media source. The implication, according to Wintemute, is \u201ca large percentage are saying, \u2018You can talk me out of it.\u2019 \u201d That points the way to potential public-health interventions, which might include consistent messaging from the media, religious leaders, and others about rejecting political violence.\n\nThe threat of violence has hovered like a nimbus cloud over this election season. The spectre of the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol remains omnipresent, but the two most visible instances of violence during the 2024 campaign have been directed at Trump. On July 13th, during a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a man on a warehouse roof fired eight times at the former President. A bullet grazed Trump\u2019s ear; one rallygoer, a former volunteer fire chief, was killed; two others were injured. Then, on September 15th, as the former President was playing a round of golf at his club in West Palm Beach, a Secret Service agent patrolling the grounds spotted the muzzle of a rifle poking out of the shrubbery along a chain-link fence. The agent opened fire and the gunman fled. After the authorities arrested him, they discovered that he had been staking out the course for hours. Democrats have also been targeted. In Tempe, Arizona, state Party officials recently closed a campaign field office after it was shot at three times in three weeks.\n\nAccording to tracking by the Bridging Divides Initiative, at Princeton University, threats and harassment of local public officials surged in July. Despite this, violence by extremist groups, as reported by a different organization, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, has actually ebbed this year, likely because law enforcement has arrested dozens of members of these groups for their participation in the Capitol riot. It makes for a perplexing picture. Is political violence an imminent threat to Americans or not? Political scientists, applying their theoretical frameworks, have long made clear the reasons for concern, including the way the country\u2019s deepest cleavages, over race, ethnicity, religion, geography, and culture, are now embedded in people\u2019s politics; the weakening of democracy\u2019s guardrails during the Trump era; and the spread of misinformation.\n\nThe promise of public health is that it rests on scientific data and offers pragmatic solutions. Treating political violence like a contagion could help safeguard the future of American democracy. And yet the same fractures that potentially drive political violence can imperil the collaboration needed to address public-health crises. They can also lead to the most dangerous symptom of all: a sense of helplessness. But, if we simply wait for the disease to strike, it may already be too late. \u2666"}, "time": {"content": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Venom: The Last Dance.\n\n\n\nThe third Venom movie may be subtitled The Last Dance, but as is the case with almost every superhero movie, it ends with post-credits scenes that tease another possible waltz to come. But the post-credits scenes dangle two storylines that in all likelihood will never be followed up on\u2014as seems to be the case with most of the post-credit scenes in Sony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe and plenty of other superhero flicks.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance follows Tom Hardy\u2019s Eddie Brock as he and the alien symbiote he\u2019s bonded with (Venom, also voiced by Hardy) flee a government agency and an unstoppable extra-terrestrial killer through the Nevada desert. Commander Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is leading the special forces pursuing Venom, as the organization known as Imperium is trying to capture all of the various symbiotes that have landed on Earth. The alien creature also pursuing them is a xenophage, a nasty monster sent by a supervillain called Knull. Played by Andy Serkis (though for most of the movie you only see the top of his head), Knull pre-dates the universe and he created all the symbiotes, only for them to turn on him and imprison him. The connection between Venom and Eddie is the key to his freedom, and Knull sends the xenophage to hunt them down.\n\nBy the end of the movie, Venom and Eddie have realized that they can\u2019t stop the xenophages, even after Strickland realizes the symbiotes are the lesser of two evils and offers Imperium's help against the monsters. As long as Venom and Eddie are connected, there\u2019s a chance Knull could be freed, so Venom ultimately opts to sacrifice himself in an acid bath that takes out the xenophages and ensures that Knull will stay locked up forever. The movie ends with Eddie gazing out at the Statue of Liberty while clips of all the good times he and Venom had over the past three films play out.\n\nBut the post-credit scenes suggest that we may not have seen the last of Knull or Venom, even though in all likelihood, we probably have.\n\nWhat Happens in the Venom: The Last Dance Post-Credits Scenes\n\nVenom: The Last Dance\u2019s first post-credit sequence comes midway through the credits. We cut back to Knull, who is still imprisoned in his throne, still looking down so we only see the top of his head and his greasy, long white hair. He\u2019s angry, and he notes that with Venom\u2019s death, The King in Black is awake and there\u2019s nobody left to protect the universe. He looks up, and we finally get a glimpse of Knull\u2019s face, looking very much like a computer-generated fantasy bad guy, akin to something from a World of Warcraft cutscene.\n\nThis is pretty standard post-credits stuff\u2014the defeated villain saying \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d\u2014but it doesn\u2019t make sense within the context of the movie that preceded it. The whole point of Venom\u2019s death was that, as long as he was alive and bonded with Eddie, there was a chance for Knull to escape his imprisonment. Knull, whose first appearance in Marvel\u2019s comics was fairly recent, in 2018, is also known as \u201cThe King in Black,\u201d so he\u2019s not teasing some new, greater threat, just impotently saying that we haven\u2019t seen the last of him.\n\nRead More: Review: Tom Hardy Is One Good Reason to See Venom\n\nThe second and final post-credits scene comes at the very end, and it\u2019s an amusing callback. Earlier in the movie, Eddie and Venom freaked out a bartender at a Mexican resort when they made themselves a drink behind the bar, using Venom\u2019s tentacles to flip (and break) bottle after bottle of booze. After Eddie left, he left a tip on the bar\u2014and unwittingly left a little bit of the symbiote with it. A few scenes later, Rex appeared at the bar, collected the symbiote sample, and took the bartender in for questioning. He is not mentioned or seen again until the post-credits scene, where the confused bartender stumbles out of the wreckage of Area 51 wondering what on earth happened. As this occurs, a cockroach crawls by the broken vial containing the symbiote sample, suggesting that, like a cockroach, Venom is harder to kill than you think.\n\nThis, again, is pretty typical for a post-credits scene\u2014a funny joke, combined with a little tease that the hero lives on. It has the bonus of not begging follow-ups the way the Knull scene does. Venom might not be dead after all! Isn\u2019t that nice? That\u2019s a very different sentiment than Knull, this villain who didn\u2019t actually do much of anything in this movie, says now he\u2019s going to actually do something. Guess we\u2019ll find out in the next movie?\n\nThe Venom movies are by far the most commercially, and, to a lesser extent, critically successful of Sony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe films. Box-office tracking for The Last Dance, especially overseas, is fairly healthy, with more than $150 million in revenue expected, so it\u2019s possible there could be a fourth movie\u2014though who knows if Hardy would want to tango a fourth time. The ending of the film, post-credits excluded, certainly feels pretty definitive. If there is no sequel, Knull\u2019s big boast will join the ranks of Madame Web\u2019s tease of a Spidey-team that will surely never see another adventure (no amount of money could get Sydney Sweeney to return for a supporting role in Madame Web 2) and Morbius's confusing multiverse-spanning Michael Keaton cameo.\n\nThe trend of dead-end post-credits scenes extends past the Sony Spider-Man movies, too. Many recent entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe end with teases that, based on the reception to the films, don\u2019t seem especially likely to get revisited. Remember when Harry Styles appeared in Eternals? Or when Hercules appeared in Thor: Love and Thunder? Or when Kelsey Grammer put on the blue makeup to play Beast again after The Marvels was all said and done?\n\nAs the future of superhero movies seems less sure than it\u2019s been for two decades now, it\u2019s only natural that post-credits scenes\u2014which frequently exist to set up the future\u2014would be in a bit of a rut, too. Venom: The Last Dance has post-credits scenes because that\u2019s what superhero movies do. Whether those scenes will matter going forward seems especially doubtful."}, "businessinsider": {"content": "Plaintiffs in 14 lawsuits call Sean Combs a rapist, including eight who sued in the past two weeks.\n\nCredible plaintiffs can help prosecutors win the Combs criminal case, legal experts say.\n\nCombs' side is already portraying plaintiffs as financial opportunists who are not to be believed.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

The organization harnesses a Google-developed artificial intelligence tool to pinpoint areas with high concentrations of poverty and storm damage. On Tuesday, it invited people in those areas to enroll in the program through a smartphone app used to manage SNAP and other government benefits. Donations will then be deposited through the app\u2019s debit card.\n\nThe approach is meant to deliver aid \u201cin as streamlined and dignified a way as possible,\u201d said Laura Keen, a senior program manager at GiveDirectly. It removes much of the burden of applying, and is intended to empower people to decide for themselves what their most pressing needs are.\n\nIt won\u2019t capture everyone who needs help \u2014 but GiveDirectly hopes the program can be a model that makes disaster aid faster and more effective. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to grow the share of disaster response that is delivered as cash, whether that is by FEMA or private actors,\u201d said Keen.\n\nThe influx of clothing, blankets, and food that typically arrive after a disaster can fill real needs, but in-kind donations can\u2019t cover getting a hotel room during an evacuation, or childcare while schools are closed.\n\n\u201cThere is an elegance to cash that allows individuals in these types of circumstances to resolve their unique needs, which are sure to be very different from the needs of their neighbors,\u201d said Keen. She added that getting money into people\u2019s hands fast can protect them from predatory lending and curb credit card debt.\n\nThe organization employs direct payments for poverty relief around the world, but it first experimented with cash disaster payments in the U.S. in 2017, when it gave money to households impacted by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Back then, GiveDirectly enrolled people in person and handed out debit cards activated later. The process took a few weeks.\n\nNow that work is done in days \u2014 remotely. A Google team uses its SKAI machine-based learning tool to narrow down the worst-hit areas by comparing pre- and post-disaster aerial imagery. GiveDirectly uses another Google-developed tool to compare those findings with poverty data. It sends the target areas to Propel, an electronic benefits transfers app, which invites users in those places to enroll.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to find a bunch of documentation that proves their eligibility,\u201d Keen said. \u201cWe already know they\u2019re eligible.\u201d\n\nStill, focusing on areas with lots of damaged buildings won\u2019t pick up all low-income households devastated by a disaster. Nor will reaching out to those already signed up for government benefits, as not all poor people enroll in them, and undocumented residents aren\u2019t eligible for them. People without smartphones can\u2019t access the app. Propel serves only 5 million of the 22 million households enrolled in SNAP benefits.\n\nIn North Carolina, where electricity in some communities has still not been restored after Hurricane Helene, having a smartphone makes no difference without a way to power it and a signal to connect to.\n\nKeen said GiveDirectly is aware of this model\u2019s shortcomings. She said some can be alleviated with a hybrid model that uses both remote and in-person enrollment. But the limitations also come down to funding. So far, GiveDirectly has raised $1.2 million for this campaign, including a $300,000 donation from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.\n\nDespite the pitfalls, GiveDirectly hopes its model sparks ideas for other direct payment programs.\n\nFEMA overhauled its own cash relief program, called Serious Needs Assistance, in January. The agency increased the payments from $500 to $750 ($770 with the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1) and eliminated the requirement that states request the aid first.\n\nAcross all Helene- and Milton-impacted states, more than 693,000 households have received Serious Needs Assistance as of Oct. 24 for a total spend of more than $522 million, according to a FEMA spokesperson.\n\nBut the program still requires households to apply, which proved problematic when misinformation about the program ran rampant in the weeks after Helene. In places with high costs of living, the $750 might not go very far.\n\nTechnology could help FEMA improve its system, said Chris Smith, who managed FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program from 2015 to 2022 and is now director of individual assistance and disaster housing at the consulting firm IEM. \u201cI think that we have to open up our imaginations that maybe there are other ways to quickly identify need and quickly identify eligibility.\u201d\n\nBut Smith cautions that a publicly funded program doesn\u2019t enjoy the same license to experiment as a philanthropic one. \u201cThere has to be ultimately an accountability of how any level of government is providing assistance to individuals. People are going to want to know that, and to have that degree of certainty is very important.\u201d\n\nThe government has experimented with other types of unconditional cash assistance, such as when it expanded the child tax credit into a monthly direct deposit payment in 2021. That program briefly cut the child poverty rate almost by half before it expired.\n\nResearch on guaranteed income programs shows recipients spend the money on their needs, said Stacia West, founding director at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Guaranteed Income Research. \u201cThere is no one who can budget better than a person in poverty,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a study tracking spending across 9,000 participants in more than 30 guaranteed income programs in the U.S., the Center for Guaranteed Income Research has found that the majority of the money is spent on retail goods, food and groceries, and transportation.\n\nWest said one-time cash payments can be a huge help to families recovering from a disaster, but the money can make a more profound difference if it\u2019s given for a sustained time.\n\nThat has happened in two U.S. disasters. In 2016, Dolly Parton funded a program that gave $1,000 per month for six months to people in Tennessee who lost their homes in the Great Smoky Mountains wildfires. The People\u2019s Fund of Maui, a program sponsored by Oprah and Dwayne Johnson, gave 8,100 adults affected by the 2023 Maui wildfires $1,200 month for six months.\n\nKeen said GiveDirectly would love to implement such a program if it had the funding, especially because long-term assistance could help people build future resilience. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only repairing your home, but also fortifying it to a level that is more protected against the next time.\u201d"}, "cnbc": {"content": "As a jobseeker, it's easy to feel like any job opportunity is a good one.

The company now manufactures its Silestone slabs with 40% crystalline silica or less and also has products with 10% or less of the mineral.\n\nCompanies that manufacture slabs of engineered stone, a popular choice for kitchen and bathroom countertops, are developing and marketing new products amid mounting concerns about stonecutters being sickened with a deadly lung disease.\n\nThe new alternatives boast reduced levels of crystalline silica, a mineral that can cause an incurable disease called silicosis if workers inhale tiny particles of dust from cutting and grinding stone.\n\nDoctors have linked a global eruption of severe silicosis among young stonecutters to the booming popularity of engineered stone, which can contain upward of 90% crystalline silica. In California, health officials have confirmed 180 cases of silicosis among countertop cutters in less than six years, resulting in at least 13 deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngineered stone manufacturers say their slabs can be cut safely with proper precautions and that shoddily run workplaces \u2014 not their products \u2014 are to blame. But amid legal battles and calls to ban engineered stone, some companies have also begun offering newer products that are lower in crystalline silica.\n\nSuch alternatives have rapidly hit the market in Australia, where government regulators recently banned the installation of engineered stone. Dr. Ryan Hoy, senior research fellow at Monash University\u2019s Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health in Melbourne, said that many of the new products are made with a form of silica from recycled glass that is \u201cfar less toxic than the crystalline form.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned, however, that such slabs may still have other dangerous elements. \u201cThere is definitely urgent need for further toxicological testing,\u201d Hoy said, but in light of the known harm that workers have suffered from crystalline silica, \u201cI think transition to these is reasonable rather than delaying it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStonecutters work in a Sun Valley shop in 2023. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe global market for engineered stone, a product prized by customers for its durability, generally lower pricing and wide variety of colors and patterns, has been valued at roughly $25 billion by market researchers.\n\nMarcos Santa Ana, president of the Southern California design-build firm Alloi, said he could recall just one client in recent years who had brought up concerns about silica content and asked about alternatives: an Australian who instead opted for a birch countertop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurning to new products gives engineered stone companies a way to stay on the market in Australia. Under rules adopted there, engineered stone \u2014 a product made by combining stone materials with chemical constituents such as resins and pigments \u2014 can still be used if it has less than 1% crystalline silica. Workplace safety officials in Australia said legal alternatives also include some products made of porcelain or \u201csintered stone,\u201d an artificial product made by binding minerals together with heat.\n\nBut the engineered stone industry has also been advertising products with lower levels of silica beyond the Australian market. One major company with headquarters in Spain, Cosentino, now manufactures its Silestone slabs with 40% crystalline silica or less and also has a range of products with 10% or less of the mineral.\n\nCosentino said in an email that it had launched research on technology that helped reduce the crystalline silica content of its products more than seven years ago, well before any ban. In Australia, where 10% crystalline silica is still above the limit for engineered stone, it sells slabs made of other materials such as porcelain.\n\nAnother company, Israel-based Caesarstone, is now marketing a \u201cCrystalline-Silica Free\u201d collection in Australia that contains less than 1% crystalline silica, according to its safety data, and said it plans to unveil similar offerings in the U.S. Its subsidiary Caesarstone USA said in a written statement that such products \u201care part of our broader commitment to leading the industry towards safer, more sustainable practices.\u201d\n\nCaesarstone USA said it also has an existing \u201clow silica\u201d line with less than 40% crystalline silica already available in the U.S. And the company added that it is now \u201cdeveloping new products with less than 1% crystalline silica, which are expected to offer even greater safety benefits,\u201d although \u201cthe success of these products in development and their market demand are still unclear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Robert Harrison, a professor of occupational medicine at UC San Francisco, said he had not seen so many cases of severe and deadly silicosis until artificial stone countertops rife with crystalline silica hit the market.\n\n\u201cThe jury is still out on whether these [new] products are completely safe,\u201d Harrison said, \u201cbut they are probably safer than the products containing crystalline silica that we\u2019re selling now in the United States.\u201d\n\nCrystalline silica ravages the lungs by scarring them from within. Scientists from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health presented research at a national conference this year that concluded that it was likely that the harmful effects suffered by countertop cutters were \u201cprimarily driven\u201d by the crystalline silica content of the material they were cutting and grinding.\n\nLeobardo Segura Meza, seen at his Pacoima home in 2023, is among the countertop cutters who suffer from silicosis, an incurable lung disease. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut when researchers at the University of Adelaide and the University of Tasmania examined how lung cells were affected by dust from stone products \u2014 including some reduced silica versions of engineered stone \u2014 the results suggested \u201csilica was not the only component that was problematic,\u201d said Chandnee Ramkissoon, a University of Adelaide research fellow in public health.\n\nAmong the other concerns Ramkissoon and her colleagues have flagged are metals such as aluminum, as well as resins that can emit volatile organic compounds when slabs are cut. They also noted that although the \u201creduced silica\u201d slabs did indeed give off less crystalline silica when they were cut, the silica particles tended to be very fine. That has health implications because tinier particles can penetrate deeper into the lungs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enough to raise questions about whether they are actually much safer,\u201d Ramkissoon said.\n\nCosentino said it had commissioned research from the Instituto de Tecnologia Ceramica in Spain, which found one of its \u201clow silica\u201d slabs emitted less crystalline silica than natural granite and had similar amounts of metals such as aluminum and tin.\n\nThe slab didn\u2019t give off detectable amounts of any \u201ctoxic organic compound\u201d when cut, nor were there \u201crelevant differences in particle sizes,\u201d according to a Cosentino summary. A representative of the Spanish institute said that under its privacy policy, it could not provide any information about the unpublished findings.\n\nCosentino and industry groups have also stressed that no matter the material, safe methods need to be employed. Any kind of stone produces dust when cut, so \u201cadhering to proper safety practices is critical, irrespective of the type of material,\u201d said Marissa Bankert, executive director of the International Surface Fabricators Assn., which represents businesses that cut and polish slabs.\n\nA worker polishes a countertop surface at a shop in Sun Valley in 2023. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSo far, California regulators have held off on the idea of banning engineered stone, instead deciding to impose stricter rules for workplace safety. A state bill setting up a licensing system for stonecutting shops was pulled back this July by its author, who said state regulators were not receptive to the idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout such a system to track stonecutting shops, Assemblywoman Luz Rivas (D-North Hollywood) said there is no way to properly enforce any safety rules. In its absence, she said, the current tack by California regulators \u201cis simply using workers as guinea pigs to find out after the fact\u201d if their efforts save lives.\n\nAsked about the new products lower in silica, Rivas expressed caution. \u201cIf these low-silica engineered stones continue to result in an uptick of silicosis among workers,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I believe a ban is the right place to be.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the Australian ban, there have been calls in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to follow suit. Industry groups have staunchly opposed that idea: Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn. director Beatrice Barbiero said that \u201cany engineered stone is safe if the proper occupational health and safety regulations and requirements are adhered to.\u201d\n\nEngineered stone companies are facing a torrent of lawsuits from workers debilitated by silicosis. In California, a jury found engineered stone companies at fault this summer in a suit brought by Gustavo Reyes Gonzalez , a 34-year-old countertop cutter who had to undergo a double lung transplant.\n\nMuch of that trial revolved around whether the blame should lie with the dusty workshops in Orange County where he labored or with the companies behind the artificial slabs. In a legal filing submitted during that case , Georgia Tech scientist Jenny Houlroyd opined that neither wet cutting nor wearing masks \u2014 commonly recommended safeguards \u2014 would make engineered stone safe to cut.\n\nHoulroyd said in an interview that the newer products need more study. \u201cIt would be wonderful,\u201d she said, \u201cif it were proven that it reduces the risk for workers. But as a scientist, I\u2019d like to see that data.\u201d"}, "commondreams": {"content": "After a decade since the launch of the Fight for $15 movement in New York City, a record number of U.S. states and communities are set to raise the minimum wage in the new year.\n\nFrom New Year's Eve to New Year's Day, the minimum wage will increase in 23 states and 41 cities and counties, according to a report released Thursday by the National Employment Law Project (NELP).

Among them are corporate giants employing hundreds of thousands of workers from coast to coast, including Amalgamated Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Best Buy, Charter Communications, Chobani, Chipotle, CVS, Ikea, JP Morgan Chase, LabCorp, Macy's, MetLife PNC, Sam's Club, Southwest Airlines, Synchrony Financial, T- Mobile, Target, Under Armour, USAA, Verizon, Walgreen's, Walmart, and Wells Fargo.\n\n\"The monumental impact of the Fight for $15 is clearly visible in this year's record wage increases as well as those in years past,\" said NELP executive director Rebecca Dixon. \"But in those same 10 years, congressional action to expand worker rights has been limited.\"\n\n\"While it is encouraging to see boosts to the minimum wage in cities and states across the country, we need federal policy to address the mounting crises brought about by record increases in the cost of living and pandemic recovery,\" she stressed. \"We must pass a higher federal minimum wage\u2014at least $15 an hour\u2014that accounts for rising costs of living and ensures that workers have the ability to support themselves and their families.\"\n\nIn March 2021, eight members of the Democratic caucus, joined all 50 Republicans in the U.S. Senate to kill legislation that would have established a $15 federal minimum wage, lifting millions of people out of poverty. Among those Democrats was Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who officially declared herself an Independent in recent weeks.\n\nState-wide polling conducted shortly before that vote last year showed a majority of Arizonans across the political spectrum in favor of increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour. In November 2021, the people of Sinema's hometown of Tucson approved a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in Arizona's second-largest city.\n\nNELP's new report notes that Tucson residents are on track to see a $15 hourly wage by 2025. The city's current rate is $13, but it is set to increase to $13.85 on January 1, with a $10.85 tipped wage\u2014both in line with the state's floor.\n\nWorker wins from 2022 highlighted in the report include campaigns in Foster City and San Mateo County, California; Hawaii; Nebraska; Tukwila, Washington; and Washington, D.C.\n\n\"In 2023 and 2024, the campaigns to watch include an $18 ballot measure in California and possible ballot measures in Arizona, Ohio, and Michigan,\" the publication points out.\n\n\"On the legislative front, there may be one fair wage campaigns in Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland,\" the report adds, \"as well as efforts to raise the minimum wage in Maryland (to speed up the state's implementation of a $15 minimum wage), Massachusetts (where the minimum will reach $15 in 2023 and there are no inflation adjustments planned for following years), and New York (where the demand is $21.25 by 2026-2027).\""}, "aljaazeera": {"content": "Commonwealth nations have pressured the UK to discuss reparations, but PM Starmer is not eager.\n\nCommonwealth leaders have gathered in Samoa for the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) this week.\n\nThis is the first time the summit has taken place on a Pacific Small Island Developing State (PSIDS).\n\nAt the summit, a demand that the United Kingdom pay reparations for its role in the transatlantic slave trade has resurfaced. While the subject is not on the official agenda, Commonwealth leaders said they would hold their own discussions \u2013 with or without the approval of the British government.\n\nA proposed section for the summit\u2019s final communique, making reference to reparations, had been vetoed by the UK. Instead, the communique, which was released on Saturday, included only a reference to possible future discussions about \u201creparatory justice with regard to the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans\u201d.\n\nSo what is the summit, and could this pressure the UK to pay reparations?\n\nWhat is the Commonwealth summit and who attended?\n\nThe Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) is held every two years, with each of the 56 Commonwealth member countries taking turns to host the summit.\n\nThis year\u2019s summit began on Monday in Samoa\u2019s capital, Apia, and ran until Saturday.\n\nThe last CHOGM, held in 2022, took place in East Africa\u2019s Rwanda.\n\nRepresentatives of 56 countries, most of which have roots in the British Empire, attended the summit.\n\nThis year, Climate change is taking centre stage in discussions. Countries are working on the Commonwealth Ocean Declaration to protect bodies of water. Countries are also discussing how to hit climate finance targets.\n\nThe summit also held discussions by Commonwealth women to push for greater gender equity.\n\nSome leaders of Commonwealth countries, including India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa, opted to attend the BRICS summit in Russia this year instead of the Commonwealth summit.\n\nUnion Minister of Parliamentary Affairs of India, Kiren Rijiju, attended the Commonwealth summit in place of Modi.\n\nFollowing every summit, the member states put forth a final joint communique.\n\nWere reparations for slavery on the agenda?\n\nNo, they were not, but many people think they should have been.\n\nFor more than 300 years, from the 15th to 19th centuries, at least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forced onto American and European ships, trafficked across the Atlantic and sold into slavery in the Americas.\n\nThe UK\u2019s involvement in the slave trade began in 1562, and by the 1730s, the UK was the biggest slave trading nation in the world, according to the UK parliament\u2019s website.\n\nThe website adds that British ships transported more than three million Africans, mainly to the UK\u2019s North American and Caribbean colonies.\n\nUK leaders have so far resisted engaging in discussions about paying reparations to the countries that received trafficked slaves \u2013 and where their descendants now live.\n\nThe British government maintains that reparations for slavery will not be paid. In April 2023, former Conservative PM Rishi Sunak refused to apologise for the UK\u2019s role in the slave trade or to pay reparations.\n\nAt this year\u2019s summit, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, confirmed that reparations would not be on the agenda.\n\nHe told reporters at the start of the summit: \u201cSlavery is abhorrent \u2026 there\u2019s no question about that. But I think from my point of view and taking the approach, I\u2019ve just taken, I\u2019d rather roll up my sleeves and work with them on the current future-facing challenges than spend a lot of time on the past.\u201d\n\nStarmer said he wanted, instead, to focus on present challenges, such as climate change.\n\nLeaders who advocate for reparations, such as the St Vincent and the Grenadines prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, argue that the legacy of the slave trade continues to plague Caribbean countries.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing for them to start with and build on \u2013 no land, no money, no training, no education,\u201d he told The Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe UK\u2019s King Charles III also addressed the summit. He said that while \u201cnone of us can change the past\u201d, we must learn lessons to \u201cright inequalities that endure\u201d. However, he did not call for reparations, instead urging leaders to find \u201ccreative ways\u201d to address the past.\n\nWhat do Commonwealth leaders say?\n\nCommonwealth leaders said they would proceed with \u201cplans to examine reparatory justice\u201d for the slave trade anyway, the BBC reported on Thursday.\n\nThe BBC reported that African leaders and officials from Caricom, a bloc of 21 Caribbean countries, were also pushing for a separate section in the official communique about reparatory justice.\n\nDuring the summit, Caricom proposed a 10-point reparation plan, including a formal apology, debt cancellation, technology transfer, assistance resolving public health crisis and illiteracy eradication.\n\nBahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis said it was time for the Commonwealth to seek \u201cjustice\u201d for the brutal history of slavery.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a conversation about this \u2026 We all appreciate this, the horrendous impact that the transatlantic slave business had on the African diaspora, and it requires justice,\u201d Davis told the news outlet Politico.\n\nHowever, UK officials succeeded in removing this separate section from the communique. Instead, the communique made a much shorter reference to possible future discussions on reparatory justice.\n\nIt mentioned calls for \u201cdiscussions on reparatory justice with regard to the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement\u2026 agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity\u201d.\n\nIf the UK had to pay reparations, what would they amount to?\n\nEven if the communique issued by the leaders at the summit had contained a directive to pay reparations, it is not legally binding. However, it would add to the mounting pressure on the UK to consider reparations.\n\nIn June 2023, the Brattle Group Report on Reparations for Transatlantic Chattel Slavery was published.\n\nBrattle is an economic consulting group based in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. The group researches economic issues for organisations and governments worldwide.\n\nBrattle compiled the report for The University of the West Indies, and former International Court of Justice jurist Patrick Robinson provided his insights into this.\n\nThe report estimated that the UK should pay $24 trillion as reparations.\n\nWho could reparations for slavery be paid by and to?\n\nThe Brattle report says the UK owes the reparations to 14 Caribbean countries. These include Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOther countries which played a role in the transatlantic slave trade, including Portugal, the Netherlands and France, have also either refused to discuss reparations or have decided against paying them.\n\nSome countries have made apologies, such as the Netherlands in 2019. However, the Netherlands also ruled out paying reparations and instead established an approximately $216mn (200 million euros) fund to promote social initiatives in the Netherlands, the Dutch Caribbean and Suriname.\n\nReparations have been paid over slavery in the past \u2013 to the owners of slaves. In 1833, the British government agreed on compensation of 20 million pounds for slave owners for the \u201closs of their property\u201d after passing legislation to abolish slavery in the British Empire, worth around $2.6bn (2 billion pounds) today."}, "propublica": {"content": "Lance Wallnau is a leading Christian right influencer who has traveled to swing states with his Courage Tour, encouraging people to sign up as poll workers who can be a \u201cspy in the camp\u201d on Election Day.\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica\u2019s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Wisconsin Watch.

Activists are now focusing on poll workers who help administer elections. Distrust Not Disrupt: Elections officials say they welcome skeptics. As the system is secure, they anticipate problems from spreading misinformation rather than interfering with the process. These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nRight-wing strategists still talk about what happened in Detroit in 2020, when poll watchers stood outside the absentee ballot counting center, banging on windows and shouting \u201cStop the count!\u201d Conspiracy theories swirled that those volunteers had been kept out while something corrupt was unfolding inside. In fact, at one point the facility held almost double the number of permitted poll watchers of both parties.\n\nBut the theories continue spreading four years later. \u201cThey kick people out that are observers, and they put cardboard over the window, and you\u2019re supposed to trust what\u2019s going on behind the cardboard?\u201d Lance Wallnau, a leading Christian right influencer, said at an Arizona tent revival in April.\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, activists have taken steps to get closer to the action. A coalition of activists on the political right, many of whom have promoted false claims about election fraud, is recruiting poll workers to administer the process themselves rather than watching from the outside. The groups are urging people to work at their local polling stations and to report perceived irregularities to those groups\u2019 external hotlines \u2014 something that could risk violating the law.\n\n\u201cPoll watcher is the person where you get kicked out if chicanery happens,\u201d Mercedes Sparks, who works for Wallnau, said at the same tent revival, explaining the recruitment initiative. \u201cIf you\u2019re a poll worker, you\u2019re the one doing the chicanery, so you can lock the door. You can kick everybody out.\u201d\n\nSparks said by email that her remarks were a \u201clighthearted joke,\u201d and that she and Wallnau \u201cmake it clear that everyone must follow election laws.\u201d Wallnau did not respond to multiple calls, emails or a list of detailed questions.\n\nThe politicized effort to recruit poll workers is concentrated in at least six swing states. ProPublica and Wisconsin Watch reviewed dozens of hours of trainings and presentations, some closed to the press, in which activists discussed their plans.\n\nActivists, including Wallnau, have told recruits they can be a \u201cspy in the camp\u201d or \u201cTrojan horse\u201d on Election Day. But while elections officials in more than a dozen swing-state counties said safeguards are in place to prevent interference, they and elections experts warned of a bigger threat: delegitimizing the process. If poll workers report their experiences to groups with a history of spreading false claims about election fraud, they may help further distrust in the system and results.\n\n\u201cI would be concerned about a repository of alleged fraud like that being used as fodder for misinformation,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cIf it\u2019s used to perpetuate conspiracy theories and false narratives about our election system, I think you could end up doing a lot of harm.\u201d\n\nPoll watcher is the person where you get kicked out if chicanery happens. If you\u2019re a poll worker, you\u2019re the one doing the chicanery, so you can lock the door. You can kick everybody out. \u2014Mercedes Sparks\n\nThe Republican and Democratic parties have historically recruited poll workers, and almost every state legally requires some amount of partisan balance. Ahead of 2024, Republicans have accused officials in five Michigan and Wisconsin cities of unfairly overlooking their nominees and overstaffing polling places with Democrats. The challenges in Flint, Michigan, and Madison, Wisconsin, were dismissed (one by a court, the other by the Wisconsin Elections Commission), and Republican applicants in some places have since filed the required paperwork and signed up; other challenges are ongoing.\n\nWhat\u2019s newer is groups outside the parties making concerted efforts to recruit poll workers themselves. The Election Integrity Network, founded by Cleta Mitchell, a former lawyer for ex-President Donald Trump, began enlisting poll workers during the 2022 midterms. Now, more groups have joined it. These include True the Vote, whose claims formed the basis of the widely debunked and eventually retracted film \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d which claimed to show election fraud, and The Lion of Judah, a group aspiring to be the \u201cChristian version of the NRA\u201d that is traveling to swing states with Wallnau to recruit conservative Christian poll workers.\n\nLate last month, Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, lent Wallnau\u2019s efforts credibility by appearing at a tour stop in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is unknown how many poll workers these groups have recruited, in part because they aren\u2019t saying and in part because election offices don\u2019t ask people about their motivation.\n\n\u201cYou have a clear admission publicly of what the game is, that they fundamentally assume that our election systems are corrupt, and so they believe that it is their job to corrupt them in their own direction,\u201d Matthew Taylor, a scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, said of Sparks\u2019 remarks.\n\nTaylor, whose new book documents the role of Christian right leaders like Wallnau in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, said the \u201cpropaganda value\u201d of having someone inside the voting system, who \u201cpresents quote unquote evidence of election fraud that does not stand up in court, that is completely debunked later on,\u201d is still enormous and bad for democracy.\n\nWallnau talks to attendees at the Pittsburgh-area stop of his Courage Tour in September.

We\u2019re Going to Induct You.\u201d\n\nHistorically, campaigns, parties and advocacy groups have enlisted volunteer poll watchers to observe the process and flag concerns. In 2020, hundreds swarmed ballot-counting centers in states where the vote was close. On social media and in unsuccessful lawsuits, Trump claimed Republican poll watchers had witnessed fraud or were denied the chance to observe, fueling conspiracy theories that the contest had been stolen from him.\n\nBut poll watchers can only look and, in some states, raise challenges. Poll workers, on the other hand, are paid to help to physically administer the election. As temporary government employees, they may register voters, check identification, issue ballots and assist with equipment. In Arizona this year, they\u2019ll also hand-count the envelopes for absentee ballots returned on Election Day. Until this week, they were going to hand-count ballots in Georgia too, but a state court judge blocked the rule.\n\nThat direct access to the voting is exactly what the activists are promising. In May, Wallnau brought his Courage Tour to a massive white tent an hour outside Detroit. He moved among the crowd, clasping his arms around believers as they swayed together to worship music. Later that day, he summoned them to their feet as he issued a holy assignment: to serve as poll workers.\n\n\u201cWho here is bothered about the election integrity issue?\u201d Wallnau asked. \u201cWho is interested in obeying God, election integrity and getting paid to do it? All right, stand up. We\u2019re going to induct you.\u201d\n\nDozens in the crowd stood, heads bowed and arms raised.\n\n\u201cI pray for an anointing. Angels will go with them, and they\u2019ll expose the hidden works of darkness,\u201d Wallnau said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be led to discover whatever nefarious things are being done by the darkness.\u201d\n\nWallnau did similar recruiting in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, directing attendees to Lion of Judah. The organization, which features Trump prominently on its website, offers a free course titled \u201cFight the Fraud,\u201d with modules detailing poll workers\u2019 basic duties and helping people find their local elections offices so they can apply as well as email templates to streamline the process. It tells students that \u201celection workers matter now more than ever\u201d because the \u201cthreat of election fraud is a serious concern\u201d and \u201cwhat happened in 2020 can never happen again!\u201d\n\nAt a Wallnau event outside Pittsburgh last month, Greg Pontinen of Murrysville, Pennsylvania, said he decided to register as a poll worker after speaking with an activist soliciting support for administering elections by hand-counting paper ballots.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s a lot of controversy, and there\u2019s a lot of people that have been in a lot of anguish over the last election, of improprieties and rigged elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you have oversight on that, you have less chance of that, and I think that\u2019s a firsthand chance for me to actually watch for that.\u201d\n\nGreg Pontinen, a Pittsburgh-area Courage Tour volunteer, decided to register as a poll worker after talking to an activist soliciting support for administering elections by hand-counting ballots. Credit: Stephanie Strasburg for ProPublica\n\nAlthough Lion of Judah\u2019s course notes that poll workers \u201cmust be impartial and follow strict guidelines to maintain the integrity of the electoral process,\u201d it also instructs workers who \u201cencounter any type of voter fraud\u201d to email their hotline with \u201cany proof if available.\u201d Joshua Standifer, founder of Lion of Judah, has referred to his strategy as a \u201cTrojan Horse.\u201d On stage in Michigan, he agreed as Wallnau told the crowd: \u201cWhen they kick everyone else out, you\u2019re the spy in the camp.\u201d\n\nStandifer said in an interview that by \u201cTrojan Horse,\u201d he means his program is a way to place principled Christians where they might not otherwise be. And he described the hotline as a tool to reassure whistleblowers that they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d and supported, as well as to ensure problems get \u201cdealt with either officially or in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\nBut state laws often detail a strict chain of command poll workers must follow on Election Day, including when they encounter possible issues, and prohibit the sharing of private voter information. By reporting information outside the polling place, elections workers risk violating their oaths of office or even state law, said Lauren Miller Karalunas, an attorney with the Brennan Center for Justice who has reviewed poll worker statutes in 11 swing states.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to encourage Christians to engage peacefully, ethically, and legally within the system,\u201d Standifer said by email. \u201cAny suggestion that we are encouraging inappropriate behavior is simply false and part of an ongoing effort to discourage Christians from participating in civic processes.\u201d\n\nLike Lion of Judah, True the Vote has established a repository to receive complaints and concerns from poll workers on Election Day: an app called VoteAlert. The platform asks users to submit information and to specify if they are poll workers, because \u201cit helps us to better anticipate a way in which to potentially support or find resources for you, if you\u2019re serving,\u201d founder Catherine Engelbrecht said during a virtual training in September. The app includes a disclaimer that users agree to follow federal and state laws limiting the ability to record in polling places.\n\nShe said her team vets every report before posting it on its platform. However, the public feed included a report that a polling place in Delaware held a bake sale enticing people to vote for certain candidates, which would be illegal. The post contained a photograph that a reverse image search revealed was at least seven years old.\n\nEngelbrecht said she would review details about the bake sale report but otherwise declined to comment. The organization said by email the post \u201cwas part of our beta testing period\u201d before its app launched. After the ProPublica-Wisconsin Watch inquiry, the group removed the post.\n\nMany of those recruiting poll workers have connections to Trump or his allies. Lion of Judah\u2019s most recent Tennessee annual corporation filing, obtained through a public records request, was submitted by Miles Terry, an attorney whose law firm partner represented Trump in his first impeachment proceeding. Terry did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nFirst image: Joshua Standifer, left, founder of The Lion of Judah, on stage with Wallnau at the Pittsburgh-area stop of the Courage Tour.

Since 2022, EIN has promoted becoming a poll worker, directing people to \u201cbecome part of the election apparatus\u201d in their communities. EIN affiliates in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin have made efforts to recruit and train poll workers in 2024. Mitchell and another EIN leader did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nDuring a June livestream on the video-sharing platform Rumble, former Trump Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli directed an audience of about 10,000 to EIN\u2019s website to sign up as poll workers. What \u201ccan make the most difference without changing the laws,\u201d Cuccinelli said, \u201cis getting more of our folks inside the polling places, not as poll watchers, but as election officials, the ones who actually sign people in in the poll books, the ones who actually count the ballots.\u201d Reached by phone, Cuccinelli said he takes every opportunity to encourage people to become poll workers and often refers them to EIN for training.\n\nHis remarks came during regular \u201celection security\u201d livestreams hosted on Rumble by Florida businessman and local Republican Party leader Steve Stern. Stern declined an interview.\n\nIn April, Christina Norton, director of election integrity for the Republican National Committee, told the livestream audience that its poll watchers and workers were the \u201cheart of this mission.\u201d When they encounter problems on Election Day, Norton said, they should \u201cimmediately report that issue back to the Republican headquarters, back to our war rooms, and then we are able to answer, mitigate or escalate these problems to resolve them in real time.\u201d An RNC spokesperson said Norton meant that only observers should contact the war room but did not respond to requests for clarification and whether the request asked workers to break the law.\n\nAn attendee signs in upon entering the Republican National Committee\u2019s Protect the Vote Tour in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, in September.

There have been isolated instances of more extreme interference. In June, an Arizona election worker was charged with stealing a magnetic security key to a vote-tabulating machine, and, in 2022, a Michigan worker was charged with copying voter information onto a personal flash drive. The Arizona worker is awaiting trial, while the Michigan worker\u2019s case was dismissed, though the dismissal is being appealed.\n\nBut elections officials across the country said there are a number of provisions to prevent poll workers from interfering with voting and ballot counting.\n\nZach Manifold, elections supervisor in Gwinnett County, Georgia, outside Atlanta, explained that poll workers must receive official training and swear an oath of office \u2014 procedures statutorily required in most states \u2014 and can be dismissed for impropriety at any time.\n\n\u201cI always tell people, if you\u2019re skeptical of the process, you should be a poll official, because \u2014 spoiler alert for them \u2014 it\u2019s a really tough job, a really long day, and they work really hard, and there\u2019s a lot of safeguards in place,\u201d Manifold said.\n\nTemporary workers, for instance, are often assigned to work on teams of at least two. And there are detailed processes for documenting who touched vote-related material and when. Administrators also try to pair new workers with experienced ones and strive to staff members of both parties at the polls.\n\n\u201cDuring our training, that is a pretty big point that we hit home is that when you are an election worker, you are nonpartisan,\u201d said George Guthrie of the Washoe County Registrar of Voters in Nevada. \u201cYou\u2019re there to essentially do a job, and that job is to make sure people have the opportunity to vote.\u201d\n\nI always tell people, if you\u2019re skeptical of the process, you should be a poll official, because \u2014 spoiler alert for them \u2014 it\u2019s a really tough job, a really long day, and they work really hard, and there\u2019s a lot of safeguards in place. \u2014Zach Manifold, elections supervisor in Gwinnett County, Georgia\n\nSome administrators also noted that they and their staff will be vigilant for workers with ulterior motives. \u201cIf you\u2019re going there to disrupt, it\u2019s going to be obvious very quickly, and you\u2019re going to be removed, and if it\u2019s something that\u2019s criminal, you\u2019re going to be prosecuted,\u201d said Jerry Holland, supervisor of elections in Duval County, Florida, home to Jacksonville.\n\nDespite Election Day safeguards, some groups also suggest that they could use poll worker testimony in lawsuits challenging the electoral process. United Sovereign Americans, a group that claims to have identified widespread voter fraud, has shared such a plan on Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying, like, hey, maybe we\u2019ll file a lawsuit down the road,\u201d founder Marly Hornik said on the show. \u201cWe\u2019re saying we already have attorneys writing these lawsuits. What we need is your reports to fill in as those are going to constitute the exhibits.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Hornik said her group is nonpartisan and insisted it is not seeking to disrupt the election. But it is planning to request injunctions stopping the certification of election results in some states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not disrupting the election,\u201d she said. \u201cThe officials who are supposed to run a legitimate process are refusing to do so.\u201d\n\nAttorneys at the Institute for Responsive Government and the Brennan Center said these efforts will likely fail. The Brennan Center has filed an amicus brief in opposition to a United Sovereign Americans\u2019 lawsuit in Maryland; that suit has been dismissed and the group is appealing.\n\nBeyond the courts, elections administrators and experts point to the broader risks of introducing misconceptions or falsehoods in the court of public opinion.\n\nDavid Levine, an elections administration consultant, has studied how Trump and others have taken advantage of human errors in service of election fraud narratives, leading to threats and harassment. That warning was borne out both by Special Counsel Jack Smith and a congressional investigation, which have laid the blame for the Capitol violence with the falsehoods spread by Trump and his team.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most troublesome aspect of this is that when you tell people that there could be fraud around every corner, you certainly can trigger them,\u201d Levine said. \u201cIf people who are recruited and receptive to these claims become election workers, and their preferred candidate, or candidates, do not win, they can become very angry, and, as we saw in 2020, take matters into their own hands.\u201d"}, "novaramedia": {"content": "Are you a Black Cat?

Rogan, a commentator on Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcasts and comedian, began podcasting in 2009 and is now the most successful host in history. The Joe Rogan Experience is continually atop the global charts on both Apple and Spotify, earning almost half a billion dollars from deals with the latter.\n\nFor months now, the Democrats and their nominee, Kamala Harris, have been polling surprisingly poorly with young men compared with previous election cycles, creating consternation among party insiders. Rogan reaches the kind of politically skeptical young men with low trust in Washington DC \u2013 and in the news media that both parties believe could help them reach the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s why at the start of the week, with polls tightening and Democrats concerned they may be \u201cblowing\u201d the election, the rumours were that it would be Harris who would appear on the podcast. It could have been one of the few media appearances that actually shifts the conversation and could have won over some undecideds. But her team eventually backed out of an appearance, perhaps concerned about the long freewheeling format. So it was announced that it would be Trump who would appear on the show.\n\nRogan\u2019s initial questioning of Trump was inquisitive and unexpected. He asked about what it felt like entering the White House with no political experience. Trump responded honestly, saying it was more surreal than later being shot in the tip of one of his ears. He said that he \u201chad made his money largely on luxury\u201d and that he was amazed by how beautiful it was inside. He talked about the difficulties of transition for a non-politician who had \u201cno experience and no idea who to appoint\u201d. He sympathised with Mary Todd Lincoln\u2019s \u201cmelancholia\u201d. It seemed like Rogan\u2019s inquisitive style might get something new from the former president.\n\nBut very quickly the interview descended into a long, rambling and often boring venture through Trump\u2019s greatest hits. He demonised migrants, spoke warmly about Vladimir Putin and falsely claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Rogan tried to push him on nuclear power and the environment. But Trump only wanted to discuss how ugly he finds windfarms \u2013 and how their vibrations upset the whales \u2013 and the ways in which environmental regulations would stop him getting permits for his buildings in New York.\n\nIn May, pollsters for the New York Times/Siena College analysed their data to see what were the key predictors for why a voter who supported Joe Biden when he defeated Trump in 2020 might defect to the Republican against Harris.\n\nThey found that the No 1 predictor was whether the voter was born in the Middle East, a reflection of the Democrats\u2019 position on the war in Gaza. The No 2 predictor was whether they had a favorable view of Rogan. For some young male voters, he\u2019s their main source of political information.\n\nRogan himself is a political riddle. He\u2019s a conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer and so is often painted as rightwing or Trump-supporting \u2013 but he\u2019s actually got a complex and often conflicting set of beliefs. He fiercely defends abortion rights, gay marriage and gun rights. He\u2019s gravitated toward outsider candidates like Bernie Sanders and RFK Jr \u2013 he voted for the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in the previous election. In 2022, Rogan described Trump as an \u201cexistential threat to democracy\u201d.\n\nHarris, who has been struggling to define herself with voters, may have found the relaxed atmosphere helpful \u2013 especially as Rogan tends to always agree with what his guests say.\n\nHe allowed to Trump brazenly lie \u2013 about election fraud, the deficit, his tax policy and many other issues \u2013 without ever challenging him. He also appeared to agree with him on many positions that he\u2019s previously taken the opposite stance and painted election deniers as an oppressed group, saying: \u201cYou get labelled, it\u2019s like being labelled an anti-vaxxer.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 US Election Edition Free newsletter The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he let Trump ramble on to a different topic: Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.\n\nBecause of this easy ride, Trump came off sounding old, doddering and unintelligent \u2013 but politically unscathed. He was allowed to blame all of America\u2019s ills on Democrats and paint himself as a great leader. He attacked Harris, calling her \u201clow IQ\u201d and that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t put two sentences together\u201d. She was one of a number of women whom Trump and Rogan dismissed as \u201cstupid\u201d, perhaps with a nod to the young misogynist voters who could be persuaded to vote for the former president.\n\nFor the most part, Rogan \u2013 not the smartest cookie himself \u2013 simply nodded along. He finished by saying having Trump on was \u201ca lot of fun\u201d.\n\nFor anyone else who made it through all three hours, that might have been the biggest lie of all."}}
