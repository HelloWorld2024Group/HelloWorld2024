We developed NEWSFLASH AI, a news summarization app that
leverages machine learning, Llama, and Pygame. The app allows
users to choose their preferred news outlets and select a news
category of interest. It then gathers news articles from those
sources and provides summarized content with headers and bullet
points for multiple articles. Leonor focused on the front-end
development, creating the app interface, user screens, buttons,
images, and text displays. This app saves users the hassle of
reading articles across multiple platforms to obtain the same
information, making it easier and more timely to stay updated
with the news.
