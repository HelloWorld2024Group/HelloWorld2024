["Nearly half of all voters are skeptical that the American experiment in self-governance is working, with 45 percent believing that the nation\u2019s democracy does not do a good job representing ordinary people, according to a new New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nThree-quarters of voters in the United States say democracy is under threat, though their perception of the forces imperiling it vary widely based on partisan leanings. And a majority of voters believe that the country is plagued by corruption, with 62 percent saying that the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good.\n\nThe eroding faith in the nearly 250-year-old American system of government follows four years of unparalleled challenges: a violent riot in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the criminal conviction of former President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Trump\u2019s continued insistence that the democratic process is rigged.\n\nCoupled with stubborn inflation, divisive culture wars and geopolitical crises, voters are expressing exasperation with American politics and a government that they believe has failed to serve them at the most basic level.", "When former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s longest serving chief of staff said the other day that his old boss \u201cfalls into the general definition of fascist,\u201d Mr. Trump let loose with the insults, assailing his onetime right hand as a \u201ctotal degenerate,\u201d a \u201cLOWLIFE\u201d and a \u201cbad General.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Trump did not do, at least at first, was actually deny that he was or aspired to be a fascist.\n\nAny other politician might consider that a damning denunciation worth rebutting. Only when asked days later did he directly dismiss the idea. But in the nine years that he has been running for or serving as president, Mr. Trump has regularly evoked the language, history and motifs of fascism without hesitation or evident concern about how it would make him look.\n\nWhile presidents have pushed the boundaries of power, and in some cases abused it outright, no American commander in chief over the past couple of centuries has so aggressively sought to discredit the institutions of democracy at home while so openly embracing and envying dictators abroad. Although plenty of presidents have been called dictators by their opponents, none has been publicly accused of fascism by his own handpicked top adviser who spent day after day with him in the Oval Office.", "Fewer than 12,000 votes in Georgia were the difference between Joseph R.

One man lay entangled with a red bicycle. Some bodies had decomposed so badly in the summer heat that they had to be identified by their teeth, according to a volunteer who helped recover the remains.\n\nThe video and photographs that captured the scene were taken in the early days of Ukraine\u2019s offensive, the first invasion of Russian territory since World War II.

In the pilot, a high school football star is discovered dead. Suspicion turns to several of his classmates, members of a heavy metal band that exploits satanic imagery.\n\nThe aesthetics of \u201cHysteria!\u201d \u2014 the wallpaper, the jeans, the popular music \u2014 are distinctly \u201980s. But the impulse to displace social anxieties onto perceived groups of outsiders is as American as apple pie. (Are those apples poisoned? Do they have razor blades inside?) And in a culture of heightened political rhetoric and pervasive misinformation, as apparent now as it was five years ago, the distance between the satanic panic and current conspiracy theories \u2014 QAnon, say, or the supposed grooming of children by queer people \u2014 is a short one, barely the length of a suburban lawn.", "A tropical storm was heading toward Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast in late September when senior news and opinion leaders of The Washington Post flew into Miami for a periodic meeting with Jeff Bezos, the newspaper\u2019s billionaire owner.\n\nDuring their visit \u2014 which included a working lunch at Mr. Bezos\u2019 sprawling home on an exclusive island in Biscayne Bay and dinner at a nearby restaurant \u2014 David Shipley, The Post\u2019s opinion editor, and Will Lewis, The Post\u2019s chief executive and publisher, discussed plans for the future of the newspaper\u2019s opinion section. The election, less than 45 days away, loomed large.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, according to four people familiar with it who spoke on condition of anonymity to relay private conversations, it appeared to Mr. Shipley and Mr. Lewis that Mr. Bezos had reservations about the Post endorsing either candidate in that race. But they also thought he was open to persuasion.\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 ultimate decision, to end the Post\u2019s decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates, exploded into public view on Friday, drawing criticism from reporters, editors and readers, along with an unusual rebuke from legendary Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.", "For years, villagers who lived near the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria had told government officials that the structure was broken and the reservoir behind it too full.\n\nBut in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.\n\n\u201cThe dam is not broken,\u201d Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. \u201cPeople should not be afraid.\u201d\n\nFour days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.", "For two years, the Republican Pennridge School Board, north of Philadelphia, governed with a burst of ideological energy.

But a high-stakes campaign has flooded the state with social media and television ads, pressing voters to consider a major change to the public school system widely seen as the nation\u2019s best.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a generation of students has been required to complete standardized exams in English, math and the sciences to earn a high school diploma. The requirement is the capstone of a rigorous set of standards that have helped set the state apart from others on achievement tests.\n\nOn Election Day, Massachusetts voters will decide whether to change course.\n\nA ballot measure known as Question 2 would eliminate the exams as a graduation mandate. If it passes, there would be no statewide requirements for receiving a diploma.\n\nThe proposal has provoked sharp divisions among Democrats, who control the state government.\n\nThe state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, which spearheaded the ballot question, has poured millions into efforts to convince voters the exam shuts out teenagers who already have the odds stacked against them. They have pointed to research showing such mandates can push more disadvantaged students to drop out.", "Deep in the vault of the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan on a late-spring day, the curator Robinson McClellan was sorting through a collection of cultural memorabilia.

The piece was moody and melancholic, and a conspicuous name was written across the top: Chopin.\n\nMcClellan took a photo on his iPhone so he could play the piece back at home on his electric piano.

Rocking Ray-Bans and an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker on his lapel \u2014 it\u2019s the first day of early voting in Texas \u2014 he is easing his way across the parking lot of his local polling place, toward TV cameras set up beside his campaign bus. Backed by sign-waving fans, he starts his brief remarks, only to be interrupted by an angry man shouting from a few yards away: \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor to democracy!\u201d\n\nSome pro-Cruz women yell back, and the heckler wanders off through the parked cars. Mr. Cruz seems not to even notice, plowing ahead with his call to \u201cKeep Texas Texas\u201d \u2014 his campaign motto \u2014 and talking up jobs, freedom and security. (That last category consists largely of horrifying stories about violent crimes perpetrated by \u201cVenezuelan gang members.\u201d) He takes shots at his Democratic opponent, Representative Colin Allred, whom he calls a formidable candidate \u201cif he were running for City Council in San Francisco.\u201d (Mr. Cruz uses this line at multiple stops. It\u2019s a real crowd pleaser.) And when asked if he\u2019s concerned about the influx of new voters to Texas in recent years and the state\u2019s shifting demographics, he fires back with absolute confidence:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nWith his buoyant delivery and smug smile, Mr. Cruz wants to remind you of something: He is never happier than seeing a liberal fantasy and crushing it. The Democratic dream of turning Texas blue is approaching middle age with nothing to show for it, but this particular hope never dies \u2014 and the goal of ousting Mr. Cruz, a b\u00eate noire of Democrats if ever there were one, will endure as long as he\u2019s in office. As in his last race in 2018, he is Democrats\u2019 top Senate target this year, with recent polling showing him just a few measly points ahead of Mr. Allred, generally within the margin of error. And once again he is being dramatically out-raised by the Democrats, a disparity made worse by the millions of dollars that national Democratic groups are pouring into the contest. It\u2019s not just that the Democrats see unseating Mr. Cruz as their best shot at holding onto their Senate majority. They also see him as the most promising opportunity to break the Republican Party\u2019s multidecade lock on statewide offices here \u2014 giving them that first crucial step toward their dream of turning Texas, if not blue, then at least purple.\n\nBut don\u2019t look for Mr. Cruz to crumble. This is basically how he rolls. The senator was a divisive, bomb-throwing, lib-owning loudmouth years before Donald Trump entered the political arena, basking in his critics\u2019 hate as if it was winter sunshine. He is known for annoying his own teammates with bone-headed moves. (Remember \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d?) Yet he somehow manages to be disruptive and bombastic enough to impress Texas Republicans without alienating at least a portion of the state\u2019s independent voters. And his in-your-face partisanship may help him walk an ideological line that might trip up other, subtler Republicans.", "It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest. He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities \u2014 wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline \u2014 that he most lacks.\n\nThose disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates.\n\nThis unequivocal, dispiriting truth \u2014 Donald Trump is not fit to be president \u2014 should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.\n\nFor this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.", "I can think of some compelling reasons that leading independent newspapers should not be in the business of endorsing candidates for president.\n\nUnfortunately, the acts of self-sabotage by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times do not reflect any of them.

I watched his strange campaign announcement, complete with a partially paid crowd and a wild, rambling speech and thought, \u201cThis man is going nowhere.\u201d\n\nAnd I thought evangelical conservatives would be the firewall against his ascendancy, not his most loyal constituency and the fuel for the fire of his political comeback after Jan. 6. I never imagined the Christian devotion to Trump that we see today.\n\nI\u2019d been an evangelical my entire life and a Republican since my teenage years. I thought I knew my own community.

Analysts said it was likely that the incumbent party would either eke out just enough seats to retain parliamentary power or would be forced to bring on new coalition partners to remain in charge.\n\n\u201cWhat is most interesting about this election is its uncertainty,\u201d said Masaru Kohno, a political scientist at Waseda University in Tokyo.", "It was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.\n\nFor centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K.

A majority of the temple\u2019s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu\u2019s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.\n\nThe case of the temple sweet shows how India\u2019s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.", "Late in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters.
