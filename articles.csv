bbc,Abercrombie & Fitch: How my investigation led to sex trafficking charges against ex-boss,[],,"How my investigation led to sex trafficking charges against ex-Abercrombie boss

In a federal courtroom in New York, for the first time I’m face to face with Mike Jeffries – the multi-millionaire ex-fashion boss I’ve spent three years investigating for the BBC. He stares at me directly, lips pursed, and chin raised, as he sits before the judge. As a result of my reporting, he was arrested this week by the FBI and charged with running an international sex trafficking and prostitution business along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman James Jacobson. Authorities acted after hearing my podcast series, The Abercrombie Guys, in which I unearthed evidence that Mr Jeffries, 80, and Mr Smith, 61, had been at the centre of a sophisticated global operation involving a network of recruiters and a middleman scouting young men for sex. As CEO of teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, Mike Jeffries was described to me as an eccentric and superstitious genius who, with his highlighted hair and penchant for flip-flops and plastic surgery, personified the youthful All-American brand he created. But now, his hair white, his fillers dissolved, and wearing an ankle monitor – he seemed a shadow of the mogul said to have used his power and strength while in charge to abuse vulnerable models. US prosecutors say he and the others accused used force, fraud and coercion to make men engage in violent and exploitative sex acts from at least 2008-2015. If convicted, they face a maximum of life in prison. Shoulders slouched, Mr Jeffries’ face was blank as his lawyer entered his plea of not guilty. His life partner Matthew Smith - a UK citizen - is yet to appear in court. He’s considered a flight risk by authorities and is currently detained until trial.

When I think back to how my own investigation began, in January 2021, I never imagined it would lead to this moment. During the pandemic, I was researching the fashion industry when I stumbled across a cryptic Instagram comment written by a former model named Barrett Pall. He was part of a group discussing how they felt abuse against male models was being ignored. “We’ve seen it happen with #MeToo, how about #UsToo?” one wrote. We soon got on the phone. After an hour of talking, he said he felt he could trust with me a secret he’d never really shared before. “It’s probably like the darkest experience I’ve ever dealt with,” he told me. “They had someone come and shave me, like my whole body, because that’s how they like the boys.” In 2011, then aged 22, Barrett said he’d been referred by an older model, who was a close friend, to meet a mysterious middleman he described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. He said this man - who I later identified through phone and property records as James Jacobson - had made him perform a sex act as a “tryout” before sending him to Mike Jeffries, then CEO and chairman of Abercrombie & Fitch, and his British partner. Barrett claimed that, for years, the duo had been throwing elaborate sex events at their palatial home in the Hamptons. He said the one he had attended was facilitated by chaperones in Abercrombie polos and flip-flops, carrying silver platters of alcohol, poppers and lube.

An old-school investigation

Barrett Pall, a former model turned life coach and activist, said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011

What Barrett told me sparked my initial two-year investigation. I travelled across America, from the suburbs of Ohio to the desert of Palm Springs, tracking down men affected and confronting those involved – including the middleman himself. Usually when I’m investigating, I can find a few loose threads to pull at by searching newspaper archives, court records or social media. But there was absolutely nothing in the public domain about these allegations. So I took an old-school approach, piecing together my own trail through word of mouth, knocking on doors, and sending handwritten letters to potential sources. I traced and contacted hundreds of people including former Abercrombie & Fitch models and Mr Jeffries’ ex-household staff, earning trust over months. Then, a massive breakthrough. Barrett Pall had an old iPad that wouldn’t turn on - but we got it fixed. Through that, I obtained an itinerary and flight ticket corroborating the event he attended in the Hamptons. It was sent by the middleman James Jacobson and contained some first names and numbers of others involved. I later recovered more than a dozen of these itineraries from different sources, finally giving me concrete leads. But it took me months to figure out their roles, not wanting to tip the wrong person off while I was still in evidence-gathering mode. Many men were wary of speaking. Two accused me of being a “spy” for Mike Jeffries – initially fearful of his “money and clout”. I, too, became increasingly paranoid after I began facing hundreds of hacking attempts each day from unknown IP addresses.

The BBC found regular sex events were held at Jeffries and Smith's home on New York's Long Island

We were right to be cautious. In their indictment, unsealed on Tuesday, prosecutors said Mike Jeffries had employed a full-service security company to oversee non-disclosure agreements (NDA), conduct background checks, and surveil and intimidate anyone who threatened to expose them. I have since spoken with more than 20 men who attended or helped organise these events for Mr Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith. Some like Luke, an aspiring model who told me he was recruited under the guise of attending an A&F photoshoot, said they had been misled and not told sex was involved. How did this operation stay hidden for so long? The answer I reached was that the shame some men felt talking about same-sex abuse had silenced them as effectively as any NDA. Some told me they had felt suicidal, others completely broken. In many instances, I was the first person they had confided in. One man, who I’m calling Alex, broke down as he told me he believed he was drugged and raped by an unknown assailant at an opulent event hosted in Marrakesh for which dozens of men had been flown in. He believed this led to him contracting HIV. “Jeffries was the kingpin,” he told me at the time. “Without him none of this could have happened.”

Jeffries' partner Matthew Smith has rarely been photographed, but the BBC obtained images of him from the 1990s

Ahead of publication, I worked with BBC Panorama to meticulously fact-check my evidence. This involved speaking with those inside the operation - including James Jacobson. When podcast producer Ruth Evans and I knocked on his door one sweltering day in rural Wisconsin in August 2023, he sank onto his steps, put his head in his hands and swore. He asked me for a deal. “Leave my name out and I’ll tell you everything,” he said. Mr Jacobson repeated this request dozens of times the following day, when he agreed to meet for coffee. We spoke for two hours. At times it was bizarre - he admired my shorthand, commented on my British accent and seemed to patronise me - calling me “sweetheart”. He’s a former actor and at one point put on a bunch of accents, and pretended to wear a cloak, trying to convince me he could do an anonymous interview. But he was charismatic too, and joked about his missing nose, saying the only job he could get these days was as a Bond villain. Eventually, Mr Jacobson said he was just “doing his job” and hadn’t spoken to Jeffries or Smith since 2015. Ultimately, he didn’t get his deal, and in court, he again sat with his head in his hands as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty.

James Jacobson worked as a middleman for Jeffries and Smith, scouting young men for sex events

After we published in October 2023, some of the men in this story took legal action against Mike Jeffries, Matthew Smith and Abercrombie & Fitch, who they are suing for rape, assault and sex trafficking. All deny wrongdoing. The lawsuit claims it’s likely that more than 100 men were abused during Jeffries' tenure. Sources also began contacting me to say they had been approached by law enforcement. We were not involved in the FBI’s investigation - which was totally independent of mine. Protecting sources is integral to my work. So, it would be the men’s decision to talk. Looking back, there were moments I considered giving up. I initially faced dead end after dead end. But the more I heard, the more I felt a duty to bring this to light for the first time and hold those involved to account. More than two years on from our first conversation, I asked Barrett Pall why he decided to speak to me. He started crying and said: “My gut said trust her. Tell her your story. And maybe, just maybe, someone will listen.” Announcing the charges, US attorney Breon Peace said: “To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using the so-called 'casting couch' system, this case should serve as a warning. Prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison.”","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1b46/live/dd5ac350-92df-11ef-ab4f-ed20fb25bf34.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/50a2/live/dd58b3e0-9405-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8248/live/2b434540-93b4-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e09b/live/b2708df0-93b1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5ec0/live/9bac0a80-9407-11ef-ae16-6171799cdd60.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2500/live/83bedc40-93b2-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/B98E/production/_130420574_office_getty.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e457/live/d48d2d60-6f55-11ef-8c1a-df523ba43a9a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e47/live/c173aca0-93b2-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1af/live/7b758d00-93c0-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9727/live/07d07d20-939c-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/50a2/live/dd58b3e0-9405-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0c1/live/20430900-93e6-11ef-8aa1-b7cc6418d634.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly07l2ppkeo

The Prince of Wales says “inspiration and guidance” from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness. In a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child - and how it helped him see “outside the palace walls”. The prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more - and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship. “When I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,” says the prince.

If passion projects reveal something about what drives someone, then perhaps his support for The Passage charity is key to unlocking Prince William’s character. The Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London’s homeless and helps them into secure accommodation. Forged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his current Homewards project, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK. “My mother took me to The Passage. She took Harry and I both there. I must have been about 11, I think, probably, at the time. Maybe 10. I’d never been to anything like that before. And I was a bit anxious as to what to expect,” he says in the ITV documentary, Prince William: We Can End Homelessness. “My mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone. ""I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone’s not got a home, they’re all going to be really sad. “But it was incredible how happy an environment it was,” recalls Prince William. The Passage has revealed four previously unseen photos of the prince visiting their London base with his mother, the princess, in June and December 1993.

“I remember having some good conversations - just playing chess and chatting,"" says the prince, of his childhood visits to The Passage. ""That’s when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don’t have the same life as you do."" Prince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled. In the ITV documentary, the prince is filmed serving food and clearing up at The Passage’s Christmas dinner, hugging some of the regular visitors there. He is even seen being bossed around by the charity’s head chef, Claudette Dawkins, as she organises her royal helper. He speaks about his concern for some of the homeless he encounters ""who are in really bad place... It's like you want to just protect them"". Over the years, the prince says he has spent a lot of time gathering information about homelessness - now he wants to do something practical to prevent it.

The prince addresses the question of his own privileged status - and argues that the point of having such a big public platform is to put it to good use, by taking action on issues such as reducing homelessness. “I feel, with my position and my platform, I should be delivering change,” he says. “I've spent enough time learning and listening to what people have been through that I feel almost guilty every time I leave that I'm not doing more to help. “I feel compelled to act, because I don't want to just talk about it. I don't want to just listen. I actually want to see someone smile because their life has been made better,"" says the prince. “Building a project is the only way I can see, at the moment, to try and alleviate [the problem], and help people who are in a much less fortunate, or in a very difficult, situation.” Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, says of Prince William's visits: ""I think he feels most at home when he's just chatting away with our clients and hearing their stories. ""People can get very nervous, but he’s very good at putting people at ease.""

Prince William's Homewards project, which has six flagship locations across the UK, aims to show homelessness is not inevitable. ""The ultimate ambition is to prove that we can prevent homelessness in these regions, so then others will come along and go, well, if they can do it, why can’t we?"" says the prince. It draws on the experience of Finland, where homelessness was effectively reduced by a policy of providing secure accommodation for people, with wrap-around support for contributory issues such as mental health problems and addiction. Among those William speaks to over the course of the film is Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, who went from being a rough sleeper to becoming a chief fire officer. She has used her own lived experience to advise the prince's current project.

The government has pledged £1.4bn to meet a target of rebuilding 50 schools in England a year, so that children do not have to learn in ""crumbling"" classrooms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves made the spending commitment ahead of the autumn Budget next week, following warnings the School Rebuilding Programme is delayed. Head teachers' unions have said more is needed for school buildings. Reeves also announced funding for the expansion of free childcare hours and of breakfast clubs in primary schools, and promised to ""protect"" education in Wednesday's Budget. Labour has warned of ""difficult decisions"" on the public finances, with government sources telling the BBC it could announce tax rises and spending cuts worth £40bn.

The funding pledge comes after the BBC revealed that 23 out of more than 500 schools on the School Rebuilding Programme had been completed so far, while the Department for Education (DfE) has been missing its targets for hiring builders. The Treasury said the funding for the next financial year was a £550m increase on spending this year, which would ""ramp up"" progress towards 50 rebuilds per year. It said overall spending on school and college buildings would be set out in the full Budget announcement. Reeves also said the government would spend £1.8bn on the expansion of government-funded childcare in the next financial year, with further details on childcare spending also expected to be set out on Wednesday. The plan to increase that funding between this financial year and the next was set out in the 2023 spring Budget under the previous Conservative government. The Treasury said it would triple spending on its rollout of free breakfast clubs for primary pupils in England, from around £11m this year to around £33m in 2025. The government has also announced £44m to support foster carers and kinship, which is a child being raised in the care of a friend or family member who is not their parent.

BBC/ Gemma Laister The BBC has been looking into why targets for the government's School Rebuilding Programme have been missed.

The government has already announced its intention to reduce winter fuel payments, add VAT to private school fees and the scrap some infrastructure projects. The BBC understands the Budget may also include: Increasing the National Insurance rate for employers and lowering the threshold for when employers start paying it

Changes to other taxes such as inheritance tax and capital gains tax

Extending the freezing of income tax thresholds

£500m in new funding to build up to 5,000 affordable social homes

Reeves said ""protecting funding for education"" was among her priorities, and that children ""should not suffer"" for the ""mess"" inherited by Labour. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she would ""never accept that any child should learn in a crumbling classroom"". Labour has repeatedly accused the previous government of leaving a £22bn ""black hole"" in the public finances - a claim previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described as ""spurious"". Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the head teachers' union, the NAHT, said the government needed to be clear about what it meant by ""protecting"" funding and called for an increase in funding per pupil for schools. He said the money for school buildings was ""helpful"" but that there was still ""a significant shortfall in terms of what is needed to restore the school estate to a satisfactory condition"". The target of rebuilding 50 schools a year has also been called ""woefully unambitious"" by Pepe Di'lasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Christine Farquharson, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the money for the programme would be ""enough to keep [it] going in its sixth year"".

The School Rebuilding Programme, first announced in 2020, aims to rebuild or refurbish about 500 schools in a decade. The BBC reported this month that a total of 23 schools have been completed so far, with a further 490 still waiting. Five more schools have since been added to the scheme. Most do not yet have builders on board. The DfE originally projected that 83 contracts would be awarded by March 2023 - but its response to a BBC Freedom of Information request revealed only 62 had been issued by June 2024. Industry experts said construction companies were nervous about taking on contracts in case costs exceed their budgets - and that extra funding would help. One school on the programme told the BBC a construction company had pulled out altogether - it suspected because of concerns about costs. The DfE told the BBC the programme was on track, and its original forecasts were made before events including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine affected industry prices.

The schools on the rebuilding programme are those the DfE deems as being most in need. But a National Audit Office report last year said funding levels in England had contributed to the ""deterioration"" of the wider school estate. It said the DfE recommended in 2020 that £5.3bn per year was needed to maintain schools once the programme was expanded. The DfE ended up requesting an average of £4bn a year between 2021 and 2025 - but the Treasury allocated an average of £3.1bn per year.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3aa4/live/f1857ce0-92e8-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/4ce981d0-936b-11ef-a941-9d6e82c6bdc4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/74c8/live/a9b83750-940e-11ef-8ecb-e5ad00aae8c8.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/74c8/live/a9b83750-940e-11ef-8ecb-e5ad00aae8c8.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/792e/live/de082910-92d9-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/19c9/live/f2fd1e20-93ab-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5fb/live/15dbcc60-92ef-11ef-80ec-3b9c13d9635e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e8e2/live/1d000d70-93ae-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/76e8/live/72d3fad0-923d-11ef-841b-8555c5ec280f.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5778m232vo
bbc,Michelle Obama: Election 'too close' with 10 days left,[],,"Michelle Obama makes fiery abortion pitch as Trump courts Muslim vote

We can't just sit around and complain, we've got to do something - Obama

Polls show the two locked in a tight race in Michigan, with Harris holding an extremely narrow lead 10 days before the 5 November election.

At another event in Michigan, Donald Trump vowed to breathe fresh life into the state's automotive industry and met with Arab-Americans he said could ""turn the election"".

In a fiery speech in Michigan - a key battleground state - Obama said the election was ""too close"" for her liking.

In her first appearance on the campaign trail alongside Vice-President Kamala Harris, former First Lady Michelle Obama urged Americans to cast their votes to protect the country from the ""dangers"" of Donald Trump.

The state, with 15 electoral college votes, could lend a deciding edge to either candidate.

President Joe Biden won Michigan by a narrow margin of 2.78% in 2020 - about 150,000 votes - helping to propel him to the presidency.

In 2016, the state went to Trump by an even narrower margin of 0.23% against Hillary Clinton.

Speaking to a crowd of thousands at an events centre in Kalamazoo, Obama made repeated jabs at Trump, pointing to what she termed his ""erratic behaviour"" and ""obvious mental decline"".

The bulk of her speech, however, focused on a ""genuine fear"" of how a Trump administration could impact abortion rights, telling an enthusiastic crowd of voters that she believes a failure to elect Kamala Harris could have deadly consequences.

Many abortion rights advocates have raised concerns that abortion bans have threatened women's lives by denying them life-saving medical treatment.

""I'm deeply concerned that so many people are buying into the lies of people who don't have our best interests at heart,"" Obama said, adding that ""ugliness will touch all of our lives"".

Harris largely echoed Obama's comments, and told young Generation Z voters she understands why they might be ""impatient"" for change.

""I want to tell you that I see you and I see your power,"" she said.

At his own rally in Novi, Michigan, Trump largely stuck to frequent campaign promises about immigration, energy and the economy.

He was also joined on stage by a number of Arab-American and Muslim community leaders, including Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi.

""We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine,"" Mr Bazzi said. ""The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make it happen.""

Trump said he believes that the Arab-American voters can ""turn the election"" one way or another.

The state is home to the 'Uncommitted' movement, which does not support Trump, but has refused to endorse Harris for what they see as a failure to take a more firm stance against Israel during the war in Gaza, such as committing to a weapons ban.

At the Democratic rally in Kalamazoo, however, some voters said they were much more preoccupied with abortion rights and perceptions that Trump is ""undemocratic"", than they were about conflicts abroad.

Ms Landon said, in her view, other issues are secondary to the health and safety of women, as well as ""their right to live the way they want to live"".

The video shows the 55-year-old backbencher during the apparent disturbance in Frodsham, Cheshire

A video has emerged appearing to show MP Mike Amesbury shouting and swearing at a man who is lying on the pavement during an apparent disturbance in Cheshire. The Labour member for Runcorn and Helsby is seen pointing to the man and saying “you won’t threaten the MP ever again, will you?” in the early hours of Saturday in Frodsham town centre. It is not clear from the footage, which was apparently filmed by an onlooker, what happened in the moments beforehand. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said officers were called to reports of an assault and were examining the circumstances.

A Labour Party representative said: ""We are aware of an incident that took place last night. We understand that Mike Amesbury MP approached Cheshire Police to report what happened this morning himself and that he will cooperate with any inquiries they have."" Posting on his own Facebook page, the 55-year-old backbencher said: ""Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends. ""This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened. ""I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police.""

Cheshire Police said: “At 02.48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham. “A caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.” The footage, which has been shared widely on X, shows some people trying to calm Mr Amesbury down, although others can be heard expressing anger and expletives.

Earlier on Friday, Mr Amesbury posted on X about attending a meeting with local residents about community safety and policing. The politician, who has been a Labour MP in Cheshire since 2017, was also a shadow minister for local government when the party was in opposition. In July 2023, a 56-year-old man was convicted of stalking and harassing the MP at his constituency office and in Frodsham town centre. The court heard the offender had stared through the office glass, asked guards about their level of security, and followed and confronted Mr Amesbury on several occasions. At the time, Mr Amesbury said it had resulted in him feeling ""that little bit more anxious"".

bbc,Child Trust Fund: 'My £250 investment is now worth only £12',[],,"'My £250 Child Trust Fund is now worth only £12'

Matt Prince Max shortly before his £250 Child Trust Fund matured into £12.39 after 18 years of being invested

When Max Prince turned 18 he got the Child Trust Fund his parents opened when he was born - only to discover surprise fees had left him with just £12.39. He was one of about six million babies, born between September 2002 and January 2011, who all received at least £250 from the government to kick start their savings. The idea was the long-term tax free savings pot would go up in value by their 18th birthdays. When Max's fund matured, investment firm Columbia Threadneedle was in charge of it. It said it had written to his parents about a £30 annual charge but the letters were returned unopened. The family had moved house and over the years the fee ate almost all of the savings.

Child Trust Funds were set up by the then Chancellor Gordon Brown with strict rules on how much could be charged in fees. The first of those funds started maturing four years ago when those babies began turning 18 and, like Max, were notified that they could finally access their savings. ""We'd been expecting this letter for a while, I mean we'd been waiting for it for 18 years basically,"" said Max. ""So when me and the family one morning opened this letter, expecting to find at the very least £300 or so, we instead saw the number £12.39. Not £120, not anything... just £12.39. ""It was certainly shocking, to say the least, and it's kind of outrageous as well.""

Matt Prince Max's mum and dad originally set up the Child Trust Fund with F&C Investments but after a series of industry takeovers it ended up with Columbia Threadneedle

'It's unexplainable'

Statements seen by the BBC show the fund was worth just over £300 by 2012. But as of 2013, a £30 annual administration charge began on the account which Max's parents said they knew nothing about. The maximum fee allowed to be charged on Child Trust Funds was set at 1.5% but the BBC has calculated Max was effectively charged 10% and more each year. The fund was originally administered by F&C Investments but after a series of industry takeovers ended up with multi-billion pound investment firm Columbia Threadneedle by the time it matured. It told the BBC the type of account chosen by Max's parents was a CTF Shares account, which has a different fee model. Subsequently the £25 plus VAT charge was for administering the account, not the underlying investment. The company told the BBC it had tried to contact Max's parents when it put in place ""the current charging structure"" but that its letters were returned unopened. Max's parents said they had moved house and did not receive the letters despite setting up a forwarding system. They said they knew the details of Max's fund and knew when it was due to mature but had not expected to be contacted before then. Columbia Threadneedle said its Child Trusts Funds ""require customers to actively make their own investment decisions and without authorisation and communication from customers, we are unable to take action on their behalf"".

Max's parents told the BBC they were unhappy with this explanation and would contact the firm to complain. Max said: ""The money was originally intended by Gordon Brown to be something that would help future adults just get off the ground a bit, get ahead in life. ""In the grand scheme of things it can't be a lot of money for the company, right? It's only around £300, so it is unfair in my opinion. ""You could say cruel. It's unexplainable I think would be the best way of putting it.""

bbc,The Bradford nurse who married train driver who saved her life,[],,"'I married the train driver who saved my life'

Charlotte and Dave Lay Charlotte and Dave married in 2022, three years after their first encounter

On a summer afternoon in 2019, nurse Charlotte Lay got ready for her night shift as normal but ""wasn't feeling quite right"". Within a short space of time she had decided to end her own life close to a West Yorkshire railway station. But thanks to the kindness of the train driver who found her in crisis, she did not go through with it. Three years later they married each other and went on to have children.

""I'd struggled with my mental health since my teens and I'd been in and out of the system since,"" Charlotte, now 33, says. Her memories of that day five years ago are ""quite blurry"" but she says she remembers seeing a train pulling up on the tracks where she was, close to Crossflatts Station, near Bradford. ""I remember seeing a man getting off the train and starting to panic and thinking he was going to tell me off,"" she recalls. ""He approached me and said 'Hi, my name is Dave, are you having a bad day?' ""I said ‘yeah, just a bit’. He went ‘OK’, we can sit and talk until it feels better.""

Charlotte says she and Dave wanted to share their story to show people who are struggling that ""life gets better""

Dave, who works for train operator Northern, remembers getting out of his cab, ""kneeling down"" in front of Charlotte and introducing himself. He told her they would talk things through ""until you feel comfortable enough"" to get onto the train, where she could be taken to safety. The pair talked for half an hour, by which time Charlotte, though still distressed, agreed to get into the cab. She was taken to Skipton Station and left in the care of the police. The following day, Charlotte was desperate to find the man who had been so kind to her and issued an appeal on a local Facebook group for anyone who worked for Northern who might be able to put her in touch. ""I’d have understood if he didn’t want to hear from me, but I just wanted to say ‘thank you’ for giving me the time and for treating me like I was human being,"" she says. Her plea was successful and after Charlotte was given Dave's number by one of his colleagues who had seen the appeal, she sent him a text. Dave, who is now 47, was equally relieved to hear from her. He says he had ""never had the opportunity"" to get off the train and talk to someone in crisis before. ""I needed to know she was all right,"" he explains. ""I’d contacted police to try to find out what happened to her and just wanted to make sure she was safe. ""I felt like I’d had a duty to make sure she was all right. We’d had that rapport built by the side of the track. It was just nice to be able to make that difference to somebody.""

The couple credit each other with saving their lives

After Dave returned Charlotte's text telling her he was available whenever she needed to speak to someone, they began exchanging messages on a daily basis. They then met for a coffee two months later and the rest was history. In 2022, the couple, who live in nearby Wilsden, got married, with Charlotte 22 weeks pregnant. But before then, there was one more twist to their story. In July 2020, Dave was diagnosed with testicular cancer, after he went to his GP with a bad back. He is adamant that he would never have gone to the doctors were it not for Charlotte's insistence. ""It's because I'm a bloke,"" he says. ""I'd done 12 or 13 years in the motor trade working on cold floors and out in the elements, lifting and carrying silly things. I just put it down to a bad back. ""Charlotte kept saying 'Go to the doctors'. I said it was just me getting old."" Weeks after his diagnosis, Dave was given the all clear. A consultant at St James' Hospital in Leeds last year told him he would no longer have been alive had he not had been diagnosed when he was. ""Charlotte may say I saved her life, which I don’t know about really, but she saved my life as well,"" Dave says.

bbc,King Charles to return to 'normal' schedule next year,[],,"King Charles returning to 'normal' schedule next year

King Charles is said to have been reinvigorated by his trip to Australia and Samoa

Heckling by an Australian senator was said to have left the King ""completely unruffled"", with him seeing free speech as the ""cornerstone of democracy"".

""We're now working on a pretty normal looking, full overseas tour programme for next year, which is a high for us to end on,"" the palace aide said.

The positive message about his health and spirits comes at the end of his biggest overseas trip since he began cancer treatment - with a more regular diary of events expected at home and abroad in 2025.

King Charles is expected to return to a ""normal"" schedule of overseas trips next year after his visits to Australia and Samoa proved a ""perfect tonic"", a Buckingham Palace official has said.

Why the King can't say 'sorry' for slavery

The King was said to be a great believer in a holistic approach - of ""mind, body and soul"" - with his recent trip having a positive impact for all three.

Continuing to work seems to be how the King wants to respond to his cancer diagnosis. That could include overseas visits in the spring and autumn of 2025, subject to his doctors' approval.

""He has genuinely loved this tour. He has genuinely thrived on the programme. It's lifted his spirits, his mood and his recovery. In that sense, the tour - despite its demands - has been the perfect tonic,"" said the palace official.

""It is hard to overstate the joy that he takes from duty and service and being in public and seeing those crowds engaging with communities across the spectrum. That really does lift the spirits. You can see that.""

His cancer treatment had been paused during his travels but is expected to begin again as he returns home. On doctors' advice, the trip did not include a further leg to New Zealand.

King Charles, who left Samoa on Saturday morning, appeared to cope well with the busy schedules of the visits, with multiple engagements on many of the days, including some controversial moments.

After a speech to parliamentarians in the Australian capital Canberra he was heckled by an independent senator, Lidia Thorpe, who shouted ""You are not my King"", in a protest about Indigenous people's rights.

That was said to have left the King untroubled.

""He was completely unruffled. He's been around a long time. As always, [he] kept calm, carried on. He believes free speech is the cornerstone of democracy, and so everyone is entitled to their views,"" the royal official said.

At the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, there was an ongoing debate over whether there should be reparations or an apology from the UK over the slave trade.

But such decisions depend on the government rather than the monarch - and the King's speech talked of learning the lessons of history.

The King was also said to have been greatly supported by Queen Camilla accompanying him on the tour.

“The King gets great strength from the Queen being there, not least when she keeps it real,"" said a palace official.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85e7/live/355a2410-929f-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e1de/live/e65cff50-92f2-11ef-8828-f1bee45a8090.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e1de/live/e65cff50-92f2-11ef-8828-f1bee45a8090.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/899d/live/57663440-928b-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8576/live/b6e8c800-91e2-11ef-be2c-57f0307db088.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c3a/live/58dba230-9207-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b98/live/cf9b9920-9298-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2450lw731o
bbc,Jeremy Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak,[],,"Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak

EPA

Israel’s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel’s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime.

Empty threats?

Iran’s official media in the hours before and after Israel’s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel’s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America’s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. ""I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,” he said. ""I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond."" Iran’s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey’s NTV network that ""any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.” Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: ""Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force."" It was, he said, ""highly misleading and baseless"" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran’s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence ""as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter"". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.

Deadly exchanges

Israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called ""axis of resistance"" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel’s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran’s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran’s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden’s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden’s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel’s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to ""take the win"" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden’s plan seemed to be working.

But since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran’s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah’s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel’s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza’s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It’s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel’s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.

bbc,Katty Kay: The social changes fuelling the men v women election,[],,"Katty Kay: What’s really behind America’s men v women election

BBC

Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election. For the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity. “Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month. And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign. “Madame President” would be a new thing for America and it’s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving. The Harris campaign won’t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is “hidden sexism” here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president. It’s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who’ll tell a pollster outright that they don’t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there’s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not “ready” or doesn't have the right “personality” or “what it takes,” what they really mean is that the problem is she’s a woman.

The Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. “Kamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he’s confident Trump will win because “the male gender gap gives us the edge”. Last time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign’s slogan “I’m with Her” was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role. Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton’s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, ‘There’s just something about her.’ She says she soon realised that “It was about the ‘her.’ That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.” While Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, “there are certain people who just think ‘A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.’” A lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination. But those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they’d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles. So for some voters, this November’s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men. “Young men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,” says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics. “Frustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask ‘what about us?’”

Della Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they’re your neighbour’s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard. Della Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than their female counterparts: they are less likely to be in relationships, they are less likely to enrol in college than they used to, they have higher rates of suicide than their female peers. Young American women meanwhile are steaming ahead. They are better educated than men, they work in service industries that are growing and increasingly they are earning more than men. In the period since Donald Trump was elected president, young women have also become significantly more liberal than young men, according to the Gallup polling group. Which is all creating a stark gender split. Over the last seven years, the share of young men who say the US has gone “too far” promoting gender equality has more than doubled, according to the American Enterprise Institute.

bbc,Georgian election: Ruling party leads but pro-EU opposition says vote was 'stolen',[],,"Georgia's pro-EU opposition says election 'stolen' as ruling party leads

Reuters The guiding force behind ruling party Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, was quick to claim victory

Georgia's increasingly authoritarian ruling party has claimed victory after preliminary results gave it a clear lead in a pivotal election focused on the country's future path in Europe. The Georgian Dream party of billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili is on 54%, based on more than 99% districts counted, the central election commission says. The initial results were dramatically different from exit polls conducted by Western pollsters and the head of one of the opposition parties said they believed the vote had been ""stolen from the Georgian people"". ""We do not accept the results of these falsified elections,"" said Tina Bokuchava, head of the United National Movement.

Another opposition leader, Nika Gvaramia, said Georgian Dream had mounted a ""constitutional coup"". Both Georgian Dream and the four pro-EU opposition groups trying to end its 12 years in power had earlier claimed victory based on competing exit polls. Voters turned out in big numbers on Saturday in this South Caucasus state bordering Russia, and there were numerous reports of vote violations and violence outside polling stations. One opposition official in a town south of the capital Tbilisi told the BBC that he was beaten up first by a local Georgian Dream councillor, and then ""another 10 men came and I didn’t know what was happening to me"". A coalition of 2,000 election observers called My Vote said given the scale of vote-fraud and violence it did not believe the preliminary results ""reflect the will of Georgian citizens"". The opposition has described this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe or Russia. Many saw the vote as the most crucial since Georgians backed independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

Matthew Goddard/BBC Opposition official Azat Karimov, 35, was beaten up in the town of Marneuli

As soon as voting ended, two exit polls by Edison and HarrisX for pro-opposition TV channels gave Georgian Dream 40.9% and 42% of the vote, with the total for the combined four opposition groups put at 51.9% and 48%. But a poll for the big, government-supporting Imedi TV channel gave Georgian Dream 56%. Some time later, the central election commission (CEC) came out with initial preliminary results. The commission had said that 90% of the vote would be released within two hours of the polls closing enabled by new electronic vote-counting system, and it was only on Sunday morning the preliminary results were almost complete. The CEC has come under criticism for being too close to the government and for rushing through electoral reform ahead of the election without sufficient consultation. ""The onus is on a government body to provide transparency required in an electoral process,"" said Dritan Nesho of HarrisX. ""We analysed the data from these precincts and there’s a wide discrepancy from the data we have. In some cases they have districts in Tbilisi where Georgian Dream are winning by 45% of the vote, whereas we know most of the opposition vote came from Tbilisi.""

Georgian Dream has already claimed an outright majority in parliament, as the combined four opposition blocs can only muster about 37% between them, according to the contested preliminary results. Under Georgia's new system of proportional representation, whoever wins half the vote wins half of the 150 seats. None of the other parties fighting the election reached the 5% threshold to get into parliament. Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, told supporters it was a ""rare occasion in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation"". However, opposition leaders and supporters had a very different take. Tina Bokuchava said her party would not accept Georgia's European future being stolen and she hoped the other main opposition groups would be able to agree on their next steps. ""This is the moment. In future there may be no such moment,"" opposition voter Levan Benidze, 36, told the BBC. ""I know there are a lot of geopolitical risks - from Russia - but this could be the pivotal moment, a turning point.""

VANO SHLAMOV/AFP The leader of the biggest opposition party, Tina Bokuchava of the United National Movement, said the Georgian people and Europe had won

Although Georgia was made a candidate to join the European Union last December, that move has since been frozen by the EU because of ""democratic backsliding - in particular a Russian-style ""foreign influence"" law targeting groups receiving Western funding. The USSR may have ceased to exist more than three decades ago, but Moscow still considers much of the old Soviet empire its own backyard and Russia’s sphere of influence. It will have appreciated Georgian Dream’s campaign promise of a “pragmatic” Russia policy, not to mention Brussels’ decision earlier this year to halt Georgia’s EU accession process. Georgian Dream has promised voters they are still on course to join the EU, but it has also accused the opposition of helping the West to open a new front in Russia's war in Ukraine. Georgia's Russian neighbour still occupies 20% of its territory after a five-day war in 2008.

Bidzina Ivanishvili's rhetoric has become increasingly anti-Western, indicating that a fourth term for Georgian Dream might pull the country back into Russia's orbit. Georgians had a simple choice, the party's founder said after voting in Tbilisi: either a government that served them, or an opposition of ""foreign agents, who will carry out only the orders of a foreign country"". He has repeatedly spoken of a ""global war party"" pushing the opposition towards joining the war in Ukraine, with Georgian Dream (GD) cast as the party of peace. For many voters the message has worked. ""The most important thing - for me, my family, my grandchildren - is peace that I wish for all Georgians,"" GD voter Tinatin Gvelesiani, 55, told the BBC at a polling station in Kojori, south-west of the capital. ""Only Georgian Dream"" would bring peace, she added.","{'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18d7/live/69459530-93bb-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f95b/live/222dd5e0-9221-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/127B9/production/_129050757_bbcm_georgia_country_profile_210323.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9c8f/live/3eeaed20-93b2-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/03D1/production/_128877900_bbcm_south-ossetia_country_profile_map_070323_v2.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5d7b/live/f1925040-93bb-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a624/live/0464a060-93b2-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18d7/live/69459530-93bb-11ef-9363-3121751be4d9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/137F7/production/_128236897_gettyimages-186092546.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b8c7/live/58acc1c0-92fe-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wqq6l99w3o
bbc,Seven takeaways from Trump's interview with Joe Rogan,[],,"In three-hour Rogan interview, Trump reveals 'biggest mistake'

Reuters

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‘s three-hour interview with America’s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released. In the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the “biggest mistake” of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea’s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists. Two years ago Rogan described Trump as “an existential threat to democracy” and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk. The Republican’s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard.

Trump on his 'biggest mistake'

Trump told Rogan the “biggest mistake” of his 2017-21 presidency was “I picked a few people I shouldn’t have picked”. “Neocons or bad people or disloyal people,” he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy. “A guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,” Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had “fascist” tendencies. Trump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as “an idiot”, but useful at times. “He was good in a certain way,” said Trump. “He’s a nutjob. ""And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’ He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.”

Trump says he told Kim Jong-un 'go to the beach'

Trump said he got to know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “very well” despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.” “By the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,” Trump said. Trump said he urged Kim to stop building up his “substantial” weapons stockpile. “I said: ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy? Go to the beach, relax. “I said: ‘You’re always building nuclear, you don’t have to do it. Relax!’ I said: ‘Let’s build some condos on your shore.’” Trump also argued that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had been president. “I said, ‘Vladimir, you're not going in,’” he told Rogan, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I used to talk to him all the time. “I can't tell you what I told him, because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.” Trump said Putin invaded Ukraine because “number one, he doesn’t respect Biden at all”. The White House has previously accused Trump of cozying up to foreign autocrats.

On 2020 election -'I lost by, like, I didn’t lose'

Asked for proof to back up his false claims that the 2020 presidential was stolen from him by mass voter fraud, Trump told Rogan: “We’ll do it another time. “I would bring in papers that you would not believe, so many different papers. That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked.” Rogan pressed him for evidence. Trump alleged irregularities with the ballots in Wisconsin and that Democrats “used Covid to cheat”. “Are you going to present this [proof] ever?” asked Rogan. “Uh…,” said Trump before pivoting to talk about how 51 former intelligence agents aligned with Joe Biden had falsely suggested that stories about his son Hunter Biden’s laptop were Russian disinformation. “I lost by, like, I didn’t lose,” said Trump, quickly correcting himself.

Harris 'very low IQ'

Trump lashed out at his political opponents and praised his allies, many of whom are likely to appeal to Rogan’s fanbase. He called his rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, a “very low IQ person” and described California's Gavin Newsom as “one of the worst governors in the world”. Trump said that Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan’s podcast in the past, was “the greatest guy”. He also said he is ""completely"" committed to bringing Robert F Kennedy Jr into a potential new Trump administration. The former independent presidential candidate, who has a close friendship with Rogan, dropped out in August and endorsed the Republican nominee. Trump said he disagrees with Kennedy on environmental policy so would instead ask the vaccine critic to ""focus on health, do whatever you want"".

On extraterrestrial life

Trump said that he hadn’t ruled out there being life in space. “There’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” he said, referring to discussions he’d had with jet pilots who'd seen “very strange” things in the sky. “Well, Mars - we’ve had probes there, and rovers, and I don’t think there’s any life there,” Rogan said. “Maybe it’s life that we don’t know about,” said Trump.

On The Apprentice

Trump said that some senior figures at NBC had tried to talk him out of running for president to keep his show The Apprentice on air. ”They wanted me to stay,” he said. “All the top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it, because they wanted to have me extend.” Trump featured in 14 series of The Apprentice from 2004, but NBC cut ties with him after he launched his 2015 bid for the presidency, citing his “derogatory” comments about immigrants.

His health is ‘unbelievable’

Trump has been under pressure from Democrats to release his medical records after Harris released hers earlier this month, which concluded she was in ""excellent health"" and fit for the presidency. Trump’s team said at the time that his doctor described him as being in ""perfect and excellent health”, without sharing his records. Trump didn’t address the topic directly on Friday’s podcast. But he told Rogan that during one physical, for which he didn’t give a date, doctors had described his ability to run on a steep treadmill as “unbelievable”. ""I was never one that could, like, run on a treadmill. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper and the doctors said, it was at Walter Reed [hospital], they said: 'It’s unbelievable!' I’m telling you, I felt I could have gone all day.” But he said treadmills are “really boring” so he prefers to stay healthy by playing golf.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4039/live/bb2e0e70-8f53-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a432/live/156b9020-92c8-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96c8/live/e4a6a830-8d1d-11ef-81f8-1f28bcc5be15.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/968c/live/bdc45be0-875f-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b01/live/f70e4420-93ac-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b8f/live/ea27ceb0-81f6-11ef-822c-a50726bfda2e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0c1/live/20430900-93e6-11ef-8aa1-b7cc6418d634.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/678d/live/b4f07e60-9009-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e002/live/84c94730-938d-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2794/live/326830a0-9315-11ef-a741-5bc7ceeb685a.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0aac/live/ecbd8ed0-8b38-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdfc/live/b3ea0cc0-93ec-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9c41/live/42184480-8dad-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e457/live/d48d2d60-6f55-11ef-8c1a-df523ba43a9a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/51b4/live/18255fe0-90ce-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9d7/live/2eed7550-8b60-11ef-8936-1185f9e7d044.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/718dfa10-93ad-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c43e/live/27ff6770-8085-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d91/live/1b3c6bd0-93ab-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f97a/live/3f5282f0-80b6-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02ac/live/56120780-912e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f01/live/7ee743e0-913e-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aeef/live/106ef7f0-8fc2-11ef-be67-d3b2237ffc84.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/15ed/live/a0385e30-81e4-11ef-ad45-893aa022fcbc.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bad7/live/a4d487b0-9360-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a225/live/51222100-8c9d-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a1af/live/7b758d00-93c0-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29c0/live/df9eccb0-8fba-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nn0913e8o
bbc,Can Rachel Reeves use her defining Budget to escape UK's 'doom loop'?,[],,"Can Rachel Reeves use her defining Budget to escape UK's 'doom loop'?

BBC

""This is it. This is what it’s all for."" In four days Rachel Reeves will stand outside No 11 holding the red Budget box up for hordes of press snappers. That moment really will be, as a prominent party figure suggested, a massive moment for Labour - and for the country. On Wednesday, the new government will reveal more about itself than ever before. We’ll know how much tax we’ll all pay, how much cash the government will spend and borrow, and the mighty financial markets will know in detail how the chancellor is changing the rules designed to prevent a public finance meltdown. “Budgets are a moment when the government actually has control,” one minister says. There have been deliberate warnings for months about how tight cash is - how No 11 needs to squeeze the public purse to make ends meet. But others in the Labour movement hope for much more than just a “Treasury budget” driven by balancing the books. They instead want a “Labour budget” - to seize the moment and prioritise public services. As one insider hopes, ""if you’re going to have a Labour government, let’s have a Labour government, not a Treasury government"". It’s a difficult balance, and the government’s attempt to seed expectations may have confused some of the public, a senior MP tells me. “Random members of the public reading it all think, ‘Oh gosh, life is collapsing, the socialist government is taking all our money,’ or you read something else and think, ‘it’s all going to be OK’.” You can read more about the plans we know about here, including Rachel Reeves’ big, planned announcement to change how the country’s enormous public debts are counted. But what will it add up to? What will Labour do with its moment of control?

A big bazooka Budget

The strapline of the Budget will be “fixing the foundations to deliver change” - not exactly the snappiest slogan in history. But ""fixing the foundations"" is fast becoming a very familiar mantra right across Labour, heard in soundbites, on social media, and in speeches galore - the government’s asking for patience from the public to sort out some deep-rooted problems in the country. And the scale of this Budget is likely to be huge. There is no doubt it will include a major set of measures amounting to billions and billions of pounds of extra tax rises like the hike in National Insurance for employers we’ve confirmed today; billions and billions of pounds of extra borrowing. A government source said: “It is a big budget because there is a hell of a lot to do to get finances back on firmer footing, and to make sure public services can keep going."" But note the ""to deliver change"" in the Budget strapline as an add on - a sign - that the chancellor is under pressure to spell out what the point of tax rises are, what the merits of squeezing some spending is. If you put up with the pain, what do you get in return? That pressure is behind the chancellor's decision to flex the spending rules she used to boast about being ""ironclad"". She wants billions to spend on roads, rail, to invest, in the hope of getting the economy growing – and extra spending on the health service and also, likely, for schools. We’ll hear more about that tomorrow with Education Secretary Bridget Philipson joining us on the show. As well as a big Budget in monetary terms, it’s a big moment in history too. The first Budget of a government with a gravity-defying majority. The first delivered by a female chancellor. And the first Labour Budget in 15 years.

A corrective Budget?

Aside from the huge price tag, there’s the purpose. The narrative inside government is that this is a “corrective” moment – essentially, cleaning up the damage done to the public finances by the pandemic, the energy shock, and what Labour would claim were damaging Tory decisions and “covering up” how bad things were in the run up to the summer’s General Election. As you’d expect, Conservatives would argue that the economy had started to turn for the better before they lost - but the independent OBR has said the extent of the problems had been masked. A ""corrective"" certainly sounds like something painful. Sources point to two previous Budgets after big moments of economic peril - the Norman Lamont Budget of 1993 after the disaster of Black Wednesday and George Osborne's 2010 emergency budget after the turmoil of the financial crisis. Both of those Budgets were notable for tax rises. This one won’t be different. Those ""corrections"", along with any big cheques that are written for health, schools or housing, will form the basis of Labour’s narrative. The message they want the public to hear is clear: things went badly wrong, and it's not going to be easy or cheap to fix them. Government sources even pitch this moment as a “last chance” after what they say are years of neglecting public services and running the country’s debt up to sort things out. Reeves will present it as a political choice, a conscious decision that contrasts to the Conservatives' record. ""Investment not decline... stability and an end to chaos."" One of her allies told me the Budget would be ""political, political, political"", choosing every opportunity to highlight the differences in her approach to the many Tory chancellors in her place before.

A political Budget?

That will be Reeves' argument – but how it lands with the party and public matters so much. And there are nerves in some quarters of the Labour Party, with some ministers very worried about how amount of cash they will have to spend. One senior source says, “no return to some form of austerity, that is the acid test – we all understand the inheritance, but there are different ways of raising money”. As with any Budget, as one MP says, ""we all have a shopping list"", and every squeeze on spending will have an accompanying howl of: how could you? Budgets can create new problems just as they can solve them. Skimping on the cash for hard-pressed local councils would cause alarm. Scrapping the £2 cap on bus fares would provoke outrage outside London. Raiding the research budget in the science department would cause upset. What about funding for the dental profession when the government is committed to 700,000 extra dental appointments? Every decision has potential pitfalls. A risk of upset, outrage - and even industrial action. A letter passed to the BBC from the Fire Brigades Union to Reeves is demanding a fair settlement for the Fire Service after years of pressure, dangling the possibility of industrial action if it doesn’t happen. There’s even a risk of strikes among pharmacies over funding, and the Royal College of Nurses has rejected ministers' pay offers so far. That's just a short pick of the very long list of dilemmas where money talks, and the chancellor’s been urged to listen.

‘Escape the doom loop’

Downing Street, both No 10 and 11, hope they can pull off a huge coup this week – to tell the public things will be hard for a while, but convince them that a better country is on the way; that higher taxes will be well spent, public services will get up off their knees, the economy will grow and we’ll all have a stake in it. There remain competing views about how to achieve that. Some are adamant that ""it will be the Labour Budget the whole country’s been waiting for... to escape the doom loop of high taxes, low growth and poor public services"". But even inside the party there’s scepticism about whether they can make it happen - a fear that No 11’s drive to balance the books, even with changed rules, will take over, preventing a bolder and cheerier message from ringing out at a huge moment. Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are fond of saying their number one priority is to grow the economy – and one source says it will not be “a Labour Budget or a Treasury budget, but a Rachel Reeves budget”. One senior figure fears that the “Treasury sees its number one mission as controlling public spending - not creating growth,” citing no difference between the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt and No 11 under Rachel Reeves. A Labour source says that “if it is a Treasury Budget, a technocrat one that focuses more on anything else on balancing the books, then it would be a let down”. Another jokes the plans are “52% Labour, 48% Treasury”, as the party has just been on the side of managing to stick to its political instincts, not the traditional money-saving drive of No 11. And what about the Budget tradition of a “rabbit out of the hat” - a nice surprise at the end of the statement? Not this time. I’m told a group of Labour staffers is eagerly holding a sweepstake about what it could be - but a source suggests, in a bleak financial situation, they stand to be sorely disappointed. “There won’t be any rabbit, it’d be like Watership Down for the poor little sod.”

Labour waited and worked a long time to get back into power. And Rachel Reeves has waited a long time for this moment, to give a Budget statement as chancellor in her dream job. The girl who saved her 20p holiday money, rather than spend it at the toy shop, now in deciding what to save and spend for us all. But the beginning of her and Sir Keir Starmer’s story in government has not been the one they dreamt of. This week is, according to a Labour source, “a golden opportunity to relaunch themselves”. Where the balance lands in Reeves’ big moment could hardly be more significant. Everyone in government understands as this source says: “We absolutely know it is the defining moment for the party and our government, this is it.”

BBC Chancellor Rachel Reeves tells the Observer that she is keeping her election promises in full, following claims she will raise taxes for working people in Wednesday Budget. She says that the upcoming Budget will be as momentous as any in Labour’s history – launching a new era of investment in health and education, among other areas.

""Starmer's 'double lie' over £40bn tax blitz"" is the main headline for the Mail on Sunday, quoting Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick. Jenrick has accused the PM Kier Starmer of lying about this and of breaking Labour's manifesto pledge about not raising taxes for working people.

The Sunday Telegraph leads on fears about what effect the Budget will have on businesses, saying there has been a ""surge"" in the number of businesses closing, including more than 1,600 this month. The paper interviews Anna Leach, from the Institute of Directors, who says there is ""huge frustration and disappointment"" among business leaders and a feeling that the prime minister does not understand business.

The daughter of murdered Conservative MP David Amess tells The Sunday Times says his killer was dropped from a de-radicalisation programme in an ""admin error"". Katie Amess wants an investigation into how the Home Office and Essex police operated in the years and days leading up to the killing.

An image of a smiling King Charles waving features on the front page of Sunday People. The King has been given the go-ahead to return to full royal duties next year by his doctors, despite his ongoing cancer treatment. The paper quotes a Buckingham Palace official, who says that the King has ""genuinely loved"" the tour of Samoa and Australia, and that it has ""lifted his spirits, his mood and his recovery"".

""Gareth cleared to get gong"" reads the main headline on the front page of The Sun after his involvement in a film investment scheme was cleared by tax authorities. The decision possibly paves the way for Southgate to be given a knighthood in the New Years Honours List.

Another football-related story features on the front page of the Daily Star, while the paper also carries one of a number of previously unseen photos of the late Princess Diana with Prince William visiting the homeless. Their release comes ahead of a new documentary, in which the prince talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child.

The upcoming documentary also features on the front page of the Daily Mirror, with the headline ""Mum is my inspiration"". The paper provides several quotes from the programme, in which Prince William will say that the inspiration his mother provided, particularly when it came to homelessness, has given him guidance over the years.

The family of Sir David Amess have given their first interview since the Conservative MP was murdered in 2021 - telling the Sunday Times they have been ""catastrophically failed"" after his killer was dropped from the government's de-radicalisation programme because of an ""admin error"". Sir David's daughter, Katie Amess, claims it is ""pretty obvious"" that the Prevent scheme ""isn't fit for purpose"". The paper argues the family deserves ""full transparency"" - insisting a report on the killer's contact with Prevent ""should surely be released"" as part of efforts to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. The Mail on Sunday says Sir Keir Starmer has rejected Conservative claims he has told a ""double lie"" by insisting this week's budget will not be a ""war on Middle Britain"" that breaks Labour's manifesto tax promises. Writing in the paper, the former Tory chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, acknowledges that his mini-budget in 2022 ""wasn't perfect"" - but warns that Wednesday will see the government declare ""naked class war"". ""The stupidity of trying to distinguish between workers and investors in property and other assets"", he says, ""is pure socialism"". The Sun on Sunday responds to the Chancellor's description of her plans as a ""budget for the strivers"" by applauding her focus on low-wage workers. But it warns that creating growth to kickstart the economy ""is more difficult"" - and suggests a ""Rwanda-style deterrent"" is needed to prevent migrants who cross the Channel in small boats from blowing a financial hole in the government's plans. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has told the Sunday Mirror that the tough decisions taken by the chancellor ""will be worth it"".

PA Media Kemi Badenoch (left) and Robert Jenrick (right) are both vying to be the new leader of the Conservative Party

The two candidates vying to be the next Conservative leader have launched what the Sunday Telegraph calls their ""fiercest attacks of the campaign so far"" in interviews with the paper. It says Kemi Badenoch appeared to question Robert Jenrick's record by pointing out she has ""never been sacked"" amid a ""whiff of impropriety"" - in an apparent reference to her rival's involvement in a planning dispute when he was housing secretary. Mr Jenrick is described as taking a swipe at the lack of policies set out by Mrs Badenoch - after he said Tory party members want ""a plan today, rather than the promise of one tomorrow"". Images of the King feature on several front pages - after Buckingham Palace said he would return to a ""normal"" schedule of overseas trips next year. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the King's successful tour of Samoa and Australia has given royal officials renewed confidence that if he can visit somewhere so logistically challenging during cancer treatment, then he can go anywhere. The Sunday Express says it's ""excited"" by the development - arguing that ""appreciation, respect and love for Charles has deepened, as he has confronted cancer with dignity and bravery"".","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/822b/live/90dc9080-0e19-11ef-82e8-cd354766a224.png.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c988/live/110f1220-93ec-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3d4/live/74278de0-93f3-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6028/live/e210e1c0-9426-11ef-a823-4919dcd8e2be.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e6e/live/b7e72070-93eb-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b77a/live/2dfe7330-93ec-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e82/live/a6307d40-0e21-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3a8/live/cd358890-93eb-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8559/live/8de94f50-93eb-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a3b/live/a3863de0-93f1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b147/live/faa32c10-93eb-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/483a/live/cbb9fa30-93ed-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy44p7jvj2o

Shivaun and Adam Raff Shivaun Raff and her husband, Adam, have been locked in a long-running legal battle with Google

""Google essentially disappeared us from the internet."" Launch days. They’re equal parts thrilling and terrifying for many start-up business founders, but they don’t get much worse than the one Shivaun Raff and her husband, Adam, experienced. It was June 2006 and the couple’s trailblazing price comparison website Foundem - one they had sacrificed well-paid jobs for and built from scratch - had just gone fully live. They didn’t know it at the time but that day, and those that followed, would mark the beginning of the end for their company.

Foundem had been hit by a Google search penalty, prompted by one of the search engine’s automatic spam filters. It pushed the website way down the lists of search results for relevant queries like ""price comparison"" and ""comparison shopping"". It meant the couple’s website, which charged a fee when customers clicked on their product listings through to other websites, struggled to make any money. ""We were monitoring our pages and how they were ranking, and then we saw them all plummet almost immediately, "" says Adam. While the launch day for Foundem didn't go to plan, it would lead to the start of something else – a 15-year legal battle that culminated in a then record €2.4bn (£2bn) fine for Google, which was deemed to have abused its market dominance. The case has been hailed as a landmark moment in the global regulation of Big Tech. Google spent seven years fighting that verdict, issued in June 2017, but in September this year Europe’s top court – the European Court of Justice – rejected its appeals. Speaking to Radio 4’s The Bottom Line in their first interview since that final verdict, Shivaun and Adam explained that at first, they thought their website’s faltering start had simply been a mistake. “We initially thought this was collateral damage, that we had been false positive detected as spam,” says Shivaun, 55. “We just assumed we had to escalate to the right place and it would be overturned.” ""If you're denied traffic, then you have no business,"" adds Adam, 58. The couple sent Google numerous requests to have the restriction lifted but, more than two years later, nothing had changed and they said they received no response. Meanwhile, their website was ""ranking completely normally"" on other search engines, but that didn't really matter, according to Shivaun, as ""everyone's using Google"". The couple would later discover that their site was not the only one to have been put at a disadvantage by Google – by the time the tech giant was found guilty and fined in 2017 there were around 20 claimants, including Kelkoo, Trivago and Yelp.

Adam, who had built a career in supercomputing, says he had the ""eureka moment"" for Foundem while smoking a cigarette outside the offices of his previous employer. Then, price comparison websites were in their infancy, and each specialised in one particular product. But Foundem was different because it let customers compare a large range of products – from clothes to flights. “No-one else was anywhere close to this,” beams Shivaun, who herself had been a software consultant for several major global brands. In its 2017 judgement, the European Commission found that Google had illegally promoted its own comparison shopping service in search results, whilst demoting those of competitors. Ten years before that, though – when Foundem launched - Adam says he had no reason to assume Google was being deliberately anti-competitive over online shopping. ""They weren't really serious players,"" he says. But by the end of 2008, the couple had started to suspect foul play. It was three weeks before Christmas and the pair received a message warning that their website had suddenly become slow to load. They thought it was a cyber attack, ""but actually it was just that everyone had started visiting our website"", Adam laughs. Channel 5’s The Gadget Show had just named Foundem the best price comparison website in the UK. “And that was really important,” Shivaun explains, ""because we then reached out to Google and said, look, surely it's not benefiting your users to make it impossible for them to find us. “And that still got from Google, not a complete ignore, but a basically ‘bog off’.” ""That was the moment we knew, OK, we need to fight,"" says Adam.

Foundem

The couple went to the press, with limited success, and took their case to regulators in the UK, US, and Brussels. It was in the latter – with the European Commission (EC) – that the case eventually took off, with the launch of an antitrust investigation in November 2010. The couple’s first meeting with the regulators took place in a portable cabin in Brussels. “One of the things they said was if this is a systemic issue, why are you the first people we’re seeing?” Shivaun recalls. “We said we're not 100% sure, but we suspect people are afraid, because all businesses on the internet essentially rely on Google for the lifeblood that is their traffic.""

bbc,The exiles who escaped Gaza for a life in limbo,[],,"BBC correspondent: I fled Gaza but I'm overwhelmed by guilt about family still there

REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa

It's been 10 months since my family left Gaza but we continue to live with the loss, the pain, the impact of the war in all its excruciating detail. This month - just before the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict - we saw the most harrowing eight hours we've experienced in that time. We received a video message from my wife's cousin in Gaza, saying: ""The tanks are surrounding us and firing at us. These could be the last moments of our lives. ""Pray for us and do anything to save us.” My wife collapsed, she even lost consciousness: her uncle, aunts and their families - 26 people in total- were all under attack. Israeli raids and advances into cities and villages all over Gaza - targeting Hamas - have been common for most of this year now. We didn't hear anything from them for several hours. They were under bombardment the whole time. Then, finally, a voice note: ""Four people have been injured. Your aunt Wafaa is bleeding, her condition is critical."" I made countless calls, to the Red Cross, the Palestinian Red Crescent, anyone who could help. After eight hours, the Israeli army finally allowed them to evacuate and move the wounded on foot. But it was too late for Wafaa - she succumbed to her injuries shortly after reaching the hospital. We still have so many relatives in Gaza. My father is there, living in a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis, which was bombed again this week. I'm often overwhelmed by guilt when I call him from Istanbul, where I’ve fled to with my wife and two children. There are so many people like me, in Turkey, in Egypt, and further afield around the world - the UK, the US, Europe - where we’ve had to go to find safety. Not everyone can get out, only those with enough money to pay the high fees for passage elsewhere. But in Egypt alone, more than 100,000 Gazans have crossed south into the country since November.

EPA Many exiles from Gaza have settled in Egypt's capital, Cairo

They’re not under immediate threat there from Israel's bombs. But many are struggling to feed their families, provide education for their children, and just re-establish the basics of a normal life. In an open-air, bustling café in Nasr City in Cairo, dozens of newly arrived refugees huddle in small groups, puffing on hookahs, sharing stories about their homeland. They're trying to alleviate the pangs of longing for those not currently with them. They cling to hope that the war will end soon, that they can return. But there’s a constant thrum of anxiety. A loud traditional Palestinian song plays over the speakers - a hit by Palestinian singer Mohammed Assaf, who won the Arab Idol competition a few years ago. “Pass through Gaza and kiss its sand. Its people are brave and its men are strong.” 58-year-old Abu Anas Ayyad is among those sitting there, listening. In his past life he had been known as the “King of Gravel”, a successful businessman who had supplied building materials to constructions sites all over Gaza. He and his family - including four children - escaped. But: “Every missile that hits a building in Gaza feels like a piece of my heart shattering. ""I still have family and friends there,” he says. “All of this could have been avoided. But Hamas has a different opinion."" He rues the Iran-backed group’s attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 and the consequences now. “Despite my love for Gaza, I will not return if Hamas remains in power,” he says. He doesn’t want his children to be “used as pawns in a dangerous game played by reckless leaders for the sake of Iran.” Sitting nearby is Mahmoud Al Khozondr, who before the war had run his family’s renowned hummus and falafel shop in Gaza. It's an institution in the territory - known for its food and celebrity clientele. The late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had been a frequent patron, often spotted at its tables. Mahmoud shows me pictures of his former well-appointed family home on his phone. They now live in a cramped two-room apartment. His children can’t go to school. “It’s a miserable life,” he says. “We lost everything back home. But we must rise again,” he says. “We need food for our children, and assistance for our people still in Gaza.” Living in exile in Egypt is not easy. The authorities have allowed Palestinians to stay temporarily, but they don’t grant official residency. They limit access to education and other key services.

bbc,The hybrid workers in France seeking fulfilment in the fields,[],,"The hybrid workers seeking fulfilment in the fields

BBC Matthew Charlton teaches at a prestigious university - when he is not growing watercress

Desperate for a break from office drudgery but scared of not making ends meet? France has an idea that might interest you: part-time farming. A new tribe has been identified that wants the best of both worlds: city and country; laptop and the land; the digital and the manual. These young mould-breakers use the opportunities of technology and workplace flexibility for a hybrid lifestyle that – they say – fits today’s desire for meaning as well as money. Working the soil brings the rewards of physical labour, and a sense of purpose too often missing from their spreadsheets and tabulations. But by edging in gently to farming, they keep the financial assurance of a back-up city salary, as well as the intellectual sustenance of their urban social circle. “In the corporate world, there are more and more people questioning the meaning of what they are doing. There’s an awful lot of burn-out and anxiety,” says Julien Maudet, data-engineer and cider-maker. “On the farm, you don’t have to ask. It’s obvious why you’re doing it. It’s to produce food for people. But you’re doing it in conditions that are often very uncertain and risky. “These two worlds - the farm and the office - are in crisis. And it dawned on me that each is the solution to the other. What we need to do is bring the two worlds together.” Maudet is one of the founders of Slasheurs-cueilleurs, an organisation that seeks to promote these new cross-over careers. The name is a wordplay in French, because it sounds like the expression chasseurs-cueilleurs (hunter-gatherers). The slasheur part comes from the slash key on a computer, and denotes someone with more than one job (as in “I’m a chef-slash-football coach).

The organisation Slasheurs-cueilleurs brings people together to exchange ideas on the part-time agricultural lifestyle

The idea came to Maudet during the Covid lockdowns, when he went to ground at his grandparents’ farm in Normandy. When he began looking a year ago, he realised that there were already hundreds of people doing what he was advocating. “We invented nothing. We just shone a light,” he says. A classic example is Matthew Charlton, an English-born teacher at Sorbonne university who now spends more than half his week growing watercress in a smallholding 64km (40 miles) south of Paris. This part of the Essonne department was once famous for its “green gold”, but many cressonnières were abandoned from the 1970s and are only now being resurrected. “The beauty of watercress is that you don’t need machinery or massive investment. It’s just you and a pair of gumboots and a knife,” says Charlton, who harvests around 30,000 bunches every year for sale to farm shops and restaurants in Paris. “Today I am at the university on Mondays and Thursdays. The other days I am here at the farm or else delivering the cress in Paris – which is where I live.

Matthew tends the land in an area once renowned for its watercress, or ""green gold""

“It’s a lifestyle that suits me perfectly. I get a lot of outdoors, then I can recharge my batteries two days a week in Paris. Eventually I want to do the cress full time, but this way I’ve been able to ease my way in, without taking on too much of a financial gamble.” Some of those who have become slasheurs have inherited family land; others rent it, or buy it, or have arrangements with farmers to pool resources. Some live in the country for a couple of days a week; some make a reverse commute to fields in the city hinterland; some work seasonally. In the city they are lawyers, engineers and consultants. In the country they are market-gardeners, winegrowers or labourers. Only a few work with livestock, which demands a more permanent presence. What seems to unite them is a yearning for spiritual fulfilment, as well as an attachment to the idea of cleaner, organic production. All agree that office-based careers have left them at times feeling redundant and pointless.

bbc,"Pixies: 'The more you try to recapture youth, the sillier it sounds'",[],,"Pixies: 'The more you try to recapture youth, the sillier it sounds'

Travis Shinn Pixies are one of the most influential bands in alt-rock (L-R): Joey Santiago, Black Francis, Emma Richardson and Dave Lovering

Pixies frontman Black Francis wouldn't be your first pick to read the CBeebies Bedtime Story. Over the course of his band's wildly influential career, his fractured, often abstract songs have referenced Biblical violence, mutilation, incest, torture and death. ""Sliced up eyeballs"" and ""goats of lust"" aren't traditionally the sort of images that help your toddler drift off to sleep. Luckily, he didn't recite his own lyrics when he popped into CBeebies earlier this month. The book he chose did have a distinct Pixies flavour, though. It's called There Was A Young Zombie Who Swallowed A Worm ""I usually don't do things like that, but I enjoyed it,"" the 59-year-old says. ""My girlfriend sort of insisted, so I did it with feeling and, you know, I raised five kids, so I'm pretty good at bedtime stories."" It's hard to imagine Pixies appearing on children's television at any other point in their career. The abrasive riffs and intertwining harmonies of songs like Debaser, Monkey Gone To Heaven, and Where Is My Mind signposted the future of alternative rock in the late 1980s; and they were cited as inspirations by everyone from Nirvana and Radiohead to... er, James Blunt. (""They'd be furious to hear that, wouldn't they?"" he recently said). Just as the artists they inspired began to hit the mainstream, the band broke up - but their reputation grew in their absence. In 2003, the NME named their 1989 album Doolittle (recorded for $40,000 in the basement of a hair salon) the second-best record of all time. Twelve years later, it sold its 300,000th copy in the UK, gaining the band their first ever platinum record, 30 years after they formed. By that point, they'd reunited for a first-rate second phase. When we speak, they're about to set off on an Australian stadium tour with Pearl Jam. ""Our audience just seems to get bigger all the time,"" Francis says... Hence the cameo on CBeebies.

Black Francis read the CBeebies Bedtime Story on Saturday, 25 October

Pixies formed in 1986, when Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) dropped out of university and persuaded his guitarist room-mate Joey Santiago to do the same. A local newspaper ad brought in bassist Kim Deal and, through her, drummer Dave Lovering. A buzzy demo tape won them a contract with British label 4AD, and they were quickly embraced by the indie music press, where one writer described their corrosive sound as ""a wild new shock"". But the secret to their success, Francis says, is simplicity. He describes the first time Pixies headlined Reading festival in 1990. Further down the bill was a group whose show was a ""very Vegas kind of affair"". ""They had lights and confetti and balloons,"" he recalls. ""A lot of schtick going on. ""Their tour manager turned to our manager, Chas Banks, and said, 'So what do you have prepared for your set?"" ""And he replied, '25 good songs'"". ""I was very proud that that's how he responded, because that is literally all we had. We had no dance moves, we had no balloons, we literally just had our music.

Francis was born Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV and played his first show at the age of eight, as part of the Boston Folk Song Society

Naïve energy

There's a tussle in the music, too, which vacillates between blood-curdling punk and what the band called ""dust-bowl songs"" - country-tinged, heartland folk ballads. Lovering has said the album is ""more traditional"" than earlier Pixies records. Francis says those seeds were sown in his 1990s solo work. ""I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'll say something that I've not said in an interview before,"" he says. ""When the Pixies broke up, I began to allow myself to stand outside of so-called underground music. I even went and made a couple of records at Nashville. ""And when we got back together, there was a lot of reticence from the producers and, quietly, behind-the-scenes, the managers, who were trying to make sure that Charles didn't turn it into some sort of 'country thing'. ""I think I deferred to that somewhat, but I didn't feel like the results were necessarily notable. So I started to allow more of that stuff into the mix. ""And I think everyone around me has, consciously or unconsciously, relaxed and allowed me to do it."" He warms to the theme, saying it's unreasonable to expect a band in their fifth decade to re-capture the spittle-flecked anger of youth. ""It gets harder to do those kind of things, because when you're young, there's so much naïvete driving the bus. Even if the song compositionally is flimsy, you make up for it with all that energy. ""But what happens is you get better at playing guitar, better at composing, and that naïve energy is gone. It's very hard to tap into it. It's much easier to tap into the I-know-what-the-hell-I'm-doing energy. ""And maybe that's not what people want to hear but, you know what? I can't be 19 years old again. And the harder you try, the sillier it sounds.""

BBC

There’s an online forum I hope you’ve never heard of. It’s a place I hope your loved ones don’t know about either. It has tens of thousands of members and millions of posts. It’s a forum where anyone, including children, can go to discuss one topic - suicide. But it's not only a talking shop. There are detailed instructions on methods, a thread where you can live-post your own death and even a “hook-up” section where members can meet others to die with. It encourages, promotes and normalises suicide. The majority of users are young, sad and vulnerable. It’s a site that gives a disturbing insight into the problems of online regulation and the state of the Online Safety Act (OSA), which has just turned one after being given Royal Assent on 26 October 2023. Its purpose was to make the UK the safest place in the world to go online. Ofcom, the online and broadcasting regulator, recognised the danger it poses. Following one of our reports, in November last year it wrote to the site to say that under the OSA (when fully operational) the site would be breaking UK law by encouraging suicide and self harm. It advised the forum administrators to take action or face further consequences in the future. The forum is thought to be based in the US, but the administrators and server locations remain unknown. By way of response, administrators posted a message on the forum saying it had blocked UK users. That “block” lasted just two days. The forum is still live now, and still accessible to young people in the UK. Indeed, my research shows at least five British children have died after contact with the site.

Demanding accountability

Ofcom concedes in private that smaller websites, based abroad with anonymous users, may be beyond its reach, even when the OSA is in full force. But big tech is likely to find it harder to simply ignore the new legal burdens the OSA will place on platforms available in the UK. However, and this is key, before the regulator Ofcom can enforce any of these duties, it's got to consult publicly on codes of practice and guidance. We are still in the consultation phase - and its real power now is the threat to tech firms of what might be to come. But while the law has yet to come in to operation it may have already started to provoke real change. This huge bit of legislation is meant to tackle everything from access to pornography and terrorism content to fake news and children’s safety. The OSA has been years in the making. In fact, you have to go back five prime ministers and at least six digital ministers to its origins. Its roots lie in a time when the public and law makers started to realise that big tech’s social media platforms held huge sway, but were not held to account. And then there was the death of the schoolgirl Molly Russell which, more than any other single story, galvanised Parliament into action. Molly’s story struck a chord. She could have been anyone’s daughter, sister, niece or friend.

Molly was just 14 when she ended her own life in November 2017. After her death, her father Ian Russell found she had been bombarded with dark, depressing content on Instagram and to a lesser extent on Pinterest. The coroner at her inquest decided that social media had ""more than minimally"" played a part in her death. She had been fed graphic, distressing content - during the inquest when it was played in open court, some people left the room. Her family decided something had to change and Mr Russell began a campaign for a law to reign in the power of Silicon Valley. Ian took his campaign to Parliament and Silicon Valley itself. He spoke to tech insiders, as well as Sir Tim Berners Lee - the founder of the modern Internet - and he even pressed his case with the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

In October last year he got his wish. As he told me recently, it was a bittersweet moment. “Seven years after Molly’s death, I remain convinced that effective regulation is the best way to protect children from the harm caused by social media, and that the Online Safety Act is the only way to prevent more families experiencing unimaginable grief,” he said. The OSA claims to be the most far-reaching law of its kind in any country. That's backed by the possibility of multi-million-pound fines against platforms and even criminal sanctions against tech bosses themselves if they repeatedly refuse to comply. It sounds tough. But the truth is many campaigners say it isn’t tough enough, or fast enough. The law will actually be introduced in three phases, but only after months of Ofcom talking to government, campaigners and big tech leaders.

All these rules are about the behaviour of platforms, but it’s worth saying that when it comes to individuals and how they act online, talk has already turned to action. New criminal offences around cyber-flashing, spreading fake news and encouraging self harm went live in January this year. But it even though the majority of the provisions of the Act are not yet enforceable, Silicon Valley does seem to be taking notice.

Silicon Valley shake-up

On 17 September, a press release popped into my inbox. It was from Meta, which owns Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook and Messenger. Nothing to get excited about, happens all the time. Only this one was different. It was effectively announcing the biggest shake up in Instagram’s short history, the creation of specific “teen accounts”. In short, it means all existing accounts belonging to under 18s would be moved to new accounts with built-in restrictions, including greater parental controls for children under 16. Any child signing up from that week would automatically get one of the new “safer” accounts. The reality of the new teen accounts may not quite match up to the hyperbole of the press release, but Meta didn’t have to make this change. Was it the spectre of the OSA that forced their hand? Yes, but only in part. It would be wrong to think that all the positive changes protecting children online have come about because of the prospect of the OSA. The UK is only one player in a global move to restrict the power of big tech. In February this year the EU’s Digital Services Act fully came into force, embedding a duty of transparency on big firms and holding them to account for illegal or harmful content. In the US, federal legislation seems to have stalled, but there lawsuits are coming that target the biggest social media platforms. Families of children harmed by their exposure to harmful content, school boards and the Attorneys General of 42 states are suing the platforms. The suits are being brought under consumer protection laws. In these cases, the claim is that social media was designed to be addictive and does not have adequate protections for children. They are seeking billions of dollars in pay-outs. The influence of Molly Russell’s story here is also significant. I have met some of those bringing these lawsuits and their lawyers. They all know her name. As do senior people in Silicon Valley. Long before the OSA became law, companies were starting to introduce better content moderation. That said, Ian Russell believes much, much more needs to be done. “While firms continue to move fast and break things, timid regulation could cost lives… We have to find a way to move faster and to be bolder”.

He has a point. End-to-end encryption means law enforcement feels it is in effect blinded when it comes to child exploitation material. If they can’t see the material, they can’t identify suspects and victims. The spread of disinformation remains unchecked on some platforms. Age verification is not yet robust. And a key emerging issue is the misuse of AI, for example in sextortion scams targeting young people. The Act is meant to be “technology neutral” and regulates the harmful effects of any new tech. But it’s not yet clear how it deals with new AI products. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, rejects much of the criticism. “From December, tech firms will be legally required to start taking action, meaning 2025 will be a pivotal year in creating a safer life online.” “Our expectations are going to be high, and we’ll be coming down hard on those who fall short.” So, are children becoming safer online thanks to the OSA? The reality is that the big tech platforms are transnational and only a global approach can force meaningful change. The OSA is just one part of a global jigsaw puzzle of laws and legal action. But pieces of that puzzle are still missing and it’s in those jagged gaps where the threat to children still lies.

bbc,Seven takeaways from Trump's interview with Joe Rogan,[],,"In three-hour Rogan interview, Trump reveals 'biggest mistake'

Reuters

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‘s three-hour interview with America’s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released. In the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the “biggest mistake” of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea’s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists. Two years ago Rogan described Trump as “an existential threat to democracy” and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk. The Republican’s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard.

Trump on his 'biggest mistake'

Trump told Rogan the “biggest mistake” of his 2017-21 presidency was “I picked a few people I shouldn’t have picked”. “Neocons or bad people or disloyal people,” he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy. “A guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,” Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had “fascist” tendencies. Trump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as “an idiot”, but useful at times. “He was good in a certain way,” said Trump. “He’s a nutjob. ""And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’ He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.”

Trump says he told Kim Jong-un 'go to the beach'

Trump said he got to know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “very well” despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.” “By the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,” Trump said. Trump said he urged Kim to stop building up his “substantial” weapons stockpile. “I said: ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy? Go to the beach, relax. “I said: ‘You’re always building nuclear, you don’t have to do it. Relax!’ I said: ‘Let’s build some condos on your shore.’” Trump also argued that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had been president. “I said, ‘Vladimir, you're not going in,’” he told Rogan, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I used to talk to him all the time. “I can't tell you what I told him, because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.” Trump said Putin invaded Ukraine because “number one, he doesn’t respect Biden at all”. The White House has previously accused Trump of cozying up to foreign autocrats.

On 2020 election -'I lost by, like, I didn’t lose'

Asked for proof to back up his false claims that the 2020 presidential was stolen from him by mass voter fraud, Trump told Rogan: “We’ll do it another time. “I would bring in papers that you would not believe, so many different papers. That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked.” Rogan pressed him for evidence. Trump alleged irregularities with the ballots in Wisconsin and that Democrats “used Covid to cheat”. “Are you going to present this [proof] ever?” asked Rogan. “Uh…,” said Trump before pivoting to talk about how 51 former intelligence agents aligned with Joe Biden had falsely suggested that stories about his son Hunter Biden’s laptop were Russian disinformation. “I lost by, like, I didn’t lose,” said Trump, quickly correcting himself.

Harris 'very low IQ'

Trump lashed out at his political opponents and praised his allies, many of whom are likely to appeal to Rogan’s fanbase. He called his rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, a “very low IQ person” and described California's Gavin Newsom as “one of the worst governors in the world”. Trump said that Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan’s podcast in the past, was “the greatest guy”. He also said he is ""completely"" committed to bringing Robert F Kennedy Jr into a potential new Trump administration. The former independent presidential candidate, who has a close friendship with Rogan, dropped out in August and endorsed the Republican nominee. Trump said he disagrees with Kennedy on environmental policy so would instead ask the vaccine critic to ""focus on health, do whatever you want"".

On extraterrestrial life

Trump said that he hadn’t ruled out there being life in space. “There’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” he said, referring to discussions he’d had with jet pilots who'd seen “very strange” things in the sky. “Well, Mars - we’ve had probes there, and rovers, and I don’t think there’s any life there,” Rogan said. “Maybe it’s life that we don’t know about,” said Trump.

On The Apprentice

Trump said that some senior figures at NBC had tried to talk him out of running for president to keep his show The Apprentice on air. ”They wanted me to stay,” he said. “All the top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it, because they wanted to have me extend.” Trump featured in 14 series of The Apprentice from 2004, but NBC cut ties with him after he launched his 2015 bid for the presidency, citing his “derogatory” comments about immigrants.

His health is ‘unbelievable’

Trump has been under pressure from Democrats to release his medical records after Harris released hers earlier this month, which concluded she was in ""excellent health"" and fit for the presidency. Trump’s team said at the time that his doctor described him as being in ""perfect and excellent health”, without sharing his records. Trump didn’t address the topic directly on Friday’s podcast. But he told Rogan that during one physical, for which he didn’t give a date, doctors had described his ability to run on a steep treadmill as “unbelievable”. ""I was never one that could, like, run on a treadmill. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper and the doctors said, it was at Walter Reed [hospital], they said: 'It’s unbelievable!' I’m telling you, I felt I could have gone all day.” But he said treadmills are “really boring” so he prefers to stay healthy by playing golf.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4039/live/bb2e0e70-8f53-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a432/live/156b9020-92c8-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96c8/live/e4a6a830-8d1d-11ef-81f8-1f28bcc5be15.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/968c/live/bdc45be0-875f-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b01/live/f70e4420-93ac-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b8f/live/ea27ceb0-81f6-11ef-822c-a50726bfda2e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0c1/live/20430900-93e6-11ef-8aa1-b7cc6418d634.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/678d/live/b4f07e60-9009-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e002/live/84c94730-938d-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2794/live/326830a0-9315-11ef-a741-5bc7ceeb685a.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0aac/live/ecbd8ed0-8b38-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdfc/live/b3ea0cc0-93ec-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9c41/live/42184480-8dad-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e457/live/d48d2d60-6f55-11ef-8c1a-df523ba43a9a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/51b4/live/18255fe0-90ce-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9d7/live/2eed7550-8b60-11ef-8936-1185f9e7d044.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/718dfa10-93ad-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c43e/live/27ff6770-8085-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d91/live/1b3c6bd0-93ab-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f97a/live/3f5282f0-80b6-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02ac/live/56120780-912e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f01/live/7ee743e0-913e-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aeef/live/106ef7f0-8fc2-11ef-be67-d3b2237ffc84.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/15ed/live/a0385e30-81e4-11ef-ad45-893aa022fcbc.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bad7/live/a4d487b0-9360-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a225/live/51222100-8c9d-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a1af/live/7b758d00-93c0-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29c0/live/df9eccb0-8fba-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nn0913e8o

Projectiles seen in sky over Tehran as Israel hits Iranian targets

Israeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran ""recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,"" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.

Tehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was ""limited damage"" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness ""to defend the state of Israel"". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be ""obliged to respond"".

The US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was ""targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm"" and suggested that was ""precisely what transpired"" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets ""in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against ""Iranian aggression"" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to ""de-escalate the situation across the region"". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed ""deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation"", while Jordan described the attack as a ""dangerous escalation"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation"". Iran's missile attack on Israel The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. ""It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,"" the agency quoted him as saying. ""Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it."" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efb9/live/87c10a90-9365-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2741/live/47d59c30-9346-11ef-be3a-49936fa3c0db.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7006/live/2ff9d3a0-9360-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/efb9/live/87c10a90-9365-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f5bb/live/aebaef80-932e-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5956/live/10dc0160-9382-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fae8/live/d9035860-9395-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr5ek4r8ro
bbc,Whitby Goth Weekend: The town where a subculture feels safe,[],,"'This town is where goths feel safe and accepted'

Danny Lawson/PA Whitby was chosen as the festival's host town due to its association with Dracula

Thirty years since the seaside town hosted its first Goth Weekend, Whitby is still a ""safe and accepting"" place, say regular visitors to the festival. Held annually in April and October, the gothic gathering began in 1994 and now attracts large crowds to Whitby's cobbled streets. Inspired by the town's association with Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, it started out as a one-off meeting of pen-friends in The Elsinore pub. This year’s celebrations will take place from 1 November and include live music and stalls, with a 30th birthday party planned for 3 November.

Elaine Horton runs goth shop Pandemonium in Whitby

Elaine Horton, owner of goth shop Pandemonium, said her business would not exist without the boost in trade from the two weekends. Her alternative store sells clothing, shoes, babywear, hair accessories, jewellery and gifts and first opened in 1999. Ms Horton said there was a large variation within the subculture. ""Believe it or not there are probably around 35 types of goth,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people who come into Whitby just for the architecture, they come to Goth Weekend because they like the clothing, they like the music, some people like all of it,"" she added.

Lancashire Police/PA The Sophie Lancaster Foundation said Whitby felt like a “second home”

Members of The Sophie Lancaster Foundation charity have been attending Whitby Goth Weekend since the 20-year-old was killed in 2007 She died after a group of boys attacked her and her boyfriend in a park in Lancashire while they were dressed in gothic clothing. Two of them were convicted of murder. The foundation has a stall at the festival to raise money for its work, educate people and keep her memory alive. Elloise Dickinson, education and engagement manager, said the event was a “special place for the foundation”. “The Whitby goths have always been there for us,"" she said. “We meet people who would see Sophie in Manchester or know people who knew her and even those who don’t come up and say: ‘We resonate with her story.’ ” Ms Dickinson said the town felt like a “second home” for the foundation. “Our heart is there,” she said. “In a place like Whitby there’s so much support. “The festival gives a chance for alternative people to come out in finery and express themselves and feel safe. “It’s important for others to see alternative people look so amazing in a way they feel comfortable. “I’ve seen people as old as 80 or 90 but also children as young as four or five who are just getting into it. “It’s really important to celebrate difference in culture and celebrate diversity.”

""Dr Crank"", who runs Whitby Walks, says the weekend had become a ""worldwide event""

""Dr Crank"", who runs ghost walks, said he had watched the goth festival grow into a ""worldwide event"". “The reason the goths like to come to Whitby, especially this time of the year, is it’s atmospheric,"" he said. Dr Crank, who also holds Halloween walks and a Dracula-themed tour, added: “You get goths from all over the world coming to Whitby, we welcome them all. “Whitby’s a very accepting town and every year they bring colour – mainly black or purple.""

Danny Lawson/PA The festival is held twice a year and welcomes visitors from around the world

Merryn Wilderspin, an artist and designer from Malton, has created two Whitby Goth Weekend collections of her made-to-order designer bags. She said: “I thought Whitby’s goth and steampunk activities could make for interesting themes."" Despite admitting she “can’t falsely claim to be a die-hard goth”, she said the weekend had a “fun atmosphere” and she loved being part of it. She said: “Goth is so much to do with fashion and music, which are natural parts of my life. “With the collections, I thought people would like to have something they can use in an everyday sense that offers a goth flavour without it being too obvious.”

Labour's first Budget for 14 years will be delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Wednesday 30 October. She has warned that it will involve ""difficult decisions"". Government sources have told the BBC the Budget could include tax rises and spending cuts to the value of £40bn.

What is the Budget?

Each year, the chancellor - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on things like health, schools, police and other public services. The previous Conservative Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, delivered the last Budget in March, before the general election. After a change of government, the new chancellor holds another Budget to set out their priorities.

When is the autumn Budget and what time is the speech?

The 2024 autumn Budget is on Wednesday, 30 October. The Budget speech usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts around an hour. It will be broadcast live on the BBC iPlayer and on the BBC News website. The current leader of the opposition, Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak, will give a speech responding to the Budget as soon as Reeves sits down.

How much money does the government want to raise?

Labour has repeatedly said that it needs to make difficult financial decisions. When Labour took power in July, Reeves said it had ""inherited the worst set of circumstances since the Second World War"" regarding government finances - something the Conservatives deny. Reeves said she was facing a £22bn ""black hole"". This gap was due to rules the government chose to follow over how much money it can borrow over the next five years. However, the chancellor told the BBC she is changing the debt rules, to allow it to fund new big projects. It is expected to permit up to £50bn more borrowing to invest in big building projects such as roads, railways or hospitals. Not all of this is expected to be allocated at the Budget. The government has said that boosting the UK economy is its priority. Following a brief recession at the end of 2023, the UK recorded the fastest growth in the G7 group of the world's richest nations during the first six months of 2024. However, the Office for National Statistics has since warned the UK's outlook was one of weaker economic growth.

On 6 August 1945, the same day the US dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, an English soldier lost his life in a plane crash on the Sperrin mountains. Petty Officer Douglas David Smith was a 21-year-old from Exley Head, Yorkshire, serving with the Royal Navy’s Fleet in Eglinton, County Londonderry. He died when his Grumman Hellcat plane crashed into the summit of Sawel, the highest peak in the area. Wreckage from the crash was recently recovered by aviation archaeologist Jonny McNee, assisted by a group of pupils from Foyle College. An appeal has been issued to trace the relatives of the fallen soldier.

Mr McNee told BBC News NI that PO Smith died whilst preparing for further possible conflict. ""He was with his air squadron, training to fly carrier-based aircraft in anticipation of them being sent to carry on the fight against the Japanese in the Pacific."" The plane in which PO Smith was flying was ""a primary weapon of the war in the Pacific"". ""Little did he know the Americans were at the last stages of the Manhattan project that subsequently helped end the war in the east."" Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced the countries surrender nine days later on 15 August 1945.

Following an appeal, on BBC Radio Leeds, to discover relations of Doulgas David Smith, BBC News NI spoke to one relative with a distant connection to the soldier. Jill Anderson, from Exley Head, heard the appeal on BBC Radio Leeds, her grandfather married Douglas David Smith's mother, who at this stage had lost both her son and husband, before remarrying. ""My dad and Douglas also knew each other, they were of a similar age before he died. Exley Head is a small place, the type of area where everybody knows everyone."" ""Knowing that his wreckage has been found is nice and important,"" Jill said. ""There is also a memorial for 'Dougie' in Exley Head, we go every year on Remembrance day. I just wish my dad was around to experience the unique news we've just heard.""

For the last seven years Mr McNee has been working alongside pupils at Foyle College in Derry to excavate and recover wreckages of plane crashes in NI. He has issued an appeal to help find family members and relatives of PO Smith. Mr McNee added: “The pupils, all aged 16 to 17, have a great interest in their local aviation history."" The school and its pupils have undertaking licenced projects with Mr McNee for seven years, including several for BBC programmes such as Digging for Britain and being part of the first licensed dig for a WW2 aircraft in NI. Mr McNee also mentioned his efforts in bringing family members to crash sites over the years, which he said is ""always a great experience to be able to give them the opportunity to see these sites.""","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a41f/live/fe06ece0-91f0-11ef-b48d-558489c034c9.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0256/live/c205e0b0-9395-11ef-a13e-cd24f25da8a4.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85d0/live/42e6f6e0-9226-11ef-9347-4b3dd7fd1c89.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2289/live/ad490a20-91e8-11ef-b13b-ab2f07e8a4da.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1241/live/3793b810-91e9-11ef-b13b-ab2f07e8a4da.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5fe0/live/a3dce7a0-9368-11ef-be61-9b83a7d0fbd8.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08f8/live/fb3645c0-9366-11ef-8352-b1001cf66534.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1241/live/3793b810-91e9-11ef-b13b-ab2f07e8a4da.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a3a1/live/e9a989a0-939f-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e01/live/ef455f80-91f9-11ef-a68e-7b3f90154b87.png.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgv28vlnpvo
bbc,"Time has come for reparations conversation, say Commonwealth leaders",[],,"Time has come for reparations dialogue, Commonwealth heads agree

Reuters

Commonwealth leaders have agreed the ""time has come"" for a conversation about reparations for the slave trade, despite the UK's desire to keep the subject off the agenda at a two-day summit in Samoa. A document signed by 56 heads of government, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, acknowledges calls for ""discussions on reparatory justice"" for the ""abhorrent"" transatlantic slave trade. The statement says it is time for a ""meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation"". Sir Keir said there had been no discussions about money at the meeting, and that the UK is ""very clear"" in its position that it would not pay reparations.

The UK has faced growing calls from Commonwealth leaders to apologise and pay reparations for the country’s historical role in the slave trade. Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as a result of slavery could take many forms, from financial to symbolic. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street had insisted the issue would not be on the agenda. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Sir Keir said Commonwealth leaders had a ""positive two days"" in Samoa and downplayed the prominence of reparations at the summit. ""The dominant theme of the two days has been resilience and climate,"" he said, adding that the section of the joint statement discussing reparations amounts to ""one paragraph in 20-something paragraphs"". ""None of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,"" he said. Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK would not pay reparations for slavery.

bbc,"Mexico Grand Prix: Sainz on pole, but Norris 'happy' with third",[],,"Title rivals Max Verstappen and Lando Norris start Sunday’s Mexico City Grand Prix from second and third on the grid behind Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz.

Verstappen heads into the race 57 points clear of Norris, who needs to gain on the Red Bull driver by an average of just under 12 points a race to overtake him in the remaining five grands prix.

Norris qualified his McLaren just 0.089 seconds slower than Verstappen, but Sainz was in a league of his own, on pole by 0.225secs from the Dutchman to underline Ferrari’s surge in form over the last few races.

The second Ferrari of Charles Leclerc, dominant winner of the United States Grand Prix last weekend, starts fourth, ahead of the Mercedes of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton.

The top four are all focused on the run to the first corner, the longest of the season, on which the powerful slipstream effect can give the advantage to the drivers in second and third on the grid.

The winner of this race has come from third on the grid - Norris’ position - in three of the last four races.

Sainz, who took his first pole since Singapore 2023 and for whom both laps in final qualifying were good enough to start at the front, said: “Probably the biggest difficult thing will be the run down into Turn One and starting on pole with a slipstream, no?

“I just need to make sure I do a good 0-100km/h, which is the most important thing when you start on pole, just make sure you do a good jump. And from there obviously do the best I can to defend.

“I have two guys behind fighting for quite important things and the run down into Turn One should be interesting. I have obviously less to lose in that sense.”

To boost his title hopes, Norris needs to win the race and hope the Ferraris finish between him and Verstappen.

But the Briton fears the pace of the Ferraris - Leclerc has taken two wins and a second in the last four races.

Norris said: “The last few weekends, they've been extremely quick and quicker than us, so it's... I don't have the confidence to say, yes, we can just beat them on pace. Like today, not on their level.

“I had definitely nowhere near close to 0.3secs left in the car. So it was more that they just went quicker. I was at the limit.”","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/716/cpsprodpb/a904/live/c186d920-93f7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/baff/live/b7b64c70-93eb-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/2bb0/live/474eb380-93f7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8ca1/live/55154540-93d1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/a904/live/c186d920-93f7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/e1d6/live/6e1ffcd0-93f7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/be7c/live/4866f490-93e7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cx288rrn172o
bbc,Why Arne Slot's Liverpool still have a lot to learn about each other - Rafa Benitez,[],,"We don't know yet how this Liverpool side will react to adversity under Slot, but I have been impressed by what I have seen so far.

Just because they have not been behind for very long in any of their games, does not mean they have not reacted and changed things during them, either.

As well as watching them against Chelsea for MOTD2 last weekend, I was at San Siro as a Uefa technical observer to see their Champions League win over AC Milan in September. Both times, they were very competitive.

They have been playing with great intensity all these years under Jurgen Klopp and it is very difficult to alter that straight away. Also, as Slot has said himself, it would be crazy to change it immediately.

So, he is keeping the good things Klopp had and, at the same time, he is giving them a little bit of defensive balance and organisation, which allows him to change their approach when he needs to.

Against Chelsea they were dropping off a little bit more, but they can still press high. Similarly, they can play penetrating passes forward, or they can use the wide areas and attack with the wingers overlapping.

Slot is giving the team more tools, to be sure they can react and adjust depending on the opponent - or so they can impose their own way to play, because if they are much better than the other team they can control possession in the opposition half, and try to find ways to create chances.

Overall, I think they have more balance and if they can continue to carry a threat in attack then we have already seen that they don't concede too many goals. Put that together, and it is the key to being successful.

They are definitely on the right path, and in a good place to go to the Emirates on Sunday. Beating Arsenal will be a good challenge and a difficult test, but I think they have the belief that they can do it, and that is the main thing.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1800/cpsprodpb/9571/live/9b4fd250-92aa-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/899/cpsprodpb/8c17/live/17bf1480-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1056/cpsprodpb/7c74/live/4880c500-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/08fc/live/2dd846b0-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/baff/live/b7b64c70-93eb-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8ca1/live/55154540-93d1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/2c93/live/7991a1f0-92e8-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/2876/live/e4b0ede0-92ae-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/be7c/live/4866f490-93e7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj4vd2ddwj9o
bbc,MLB World Series 2024: Dodgers 4-2 Yankees - Yoshinobu Yamamoto stars in game two,[],,"Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto dominated the New York Yankees on his World Series debut as his Los Angeles Dodgers team closed out a 4-2 win to lead the best-of-seven series 2-0.

The hosts also thrilled the raucous Dodger Stadium crowd with three home runs, and survived a last-gasp Yankees rally as the National League champions took charge of the 'Fall Classic'.

In contrast to the scoreless first half of game one, both teams were on the board early as the Dodgers' Tommy Edman and the Yankees' Juan Soto traded solo home runs.

But the hosts then staged a home run derby of their own in the third inning, with Teoscar Hernandez and Friday's walk-off hero Freddie Freeman both going deep to give the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.

Yamamoto, who penned a 12-year contract worth $325m (£251m) - a Major League Baseball record for a pitcher - when he joined the Dodgers from the Japanese league last December, pitched into the seventh inning, with Soto's homer the only hit he allowed.

The Yankees offence, with star batter Aaron Judge hitless and striking out three times, fared no better against the bullpen until they rallied in the ninth inning.

The visitors were in the last chance saloon when Soto led off with a base hit, advanced to second on a wild pitch and was driven in by Giancarlo Stanton to make it 4-2.

Jazz Chisholm Jr singled and Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch to load the bases, but Anthony Volpe struck out and, with the Yankees down to their last out, pinch-hitter Jose Trevino flew out to centre field.

A bigger concern for the Dodgers was when designated hitter Shohei Ohtani left the field in some pain after injuring his left shoulder during a failed stolen base attempt in the seventh inning.

The series now moves to New York, with game three at Yankee Stadium on Monday evening.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/f900/live/157db3e0-940d-11ef-bbf6-6f70447d4ea0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/1eba/live/600ff610-9409-11ef-a155-77866d7bee1b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/b669/live/5aa50840-919e-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/baff/live/b7b64c70-93eb-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/da9a/live/47c7cf90-9401-11ef-93f4-31a13f686d65.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8ca1/live/55154540-93d1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/1eba/live/600ff610-9409-11ef-a155-77866d7bee1b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/ead7/live/2d72e920-93f9-11ef-b94e-251614a7be36.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/be7c/live/4866f490-93e7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cvg779enke8o
bbc,Man City 1-0 Southampton: Pep Guardiola says he 'will learn' from Russell Martin,[],,"Southampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected.

They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season.

Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago.

But a strange thing happened at Etihad Stadium.

Speaking to the media after Saturday's 1-0 result, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team.

It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner.

Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence.

Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City’s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively.

If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in.

""I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,"" said Martin.

""There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision.

""But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager.

""To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.""

That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/0d7b/live/4de51580-fea2-11ee-a9f7-4d961743aa47.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/baff/live/b7b64c70-93eb-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8ca1/live/55154540-93d1-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/762/cpsprodpb/f500/live/91cab290-93c7-11ef-bc46-3b8d5ca55e66.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/f500/live/91cab290-93c7-11ef-bc46-3b8d5ca55e66.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/be7c/live/4866f490-93e7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yrrrx5pr0o
bbc,"Catterall vs Prograis: Briton wins thriller, plus Campbell Hatton loses",[],,"Jack Catterall earned his third headline win in a year and put himself in position for a title fight in 2025 with victory over Regis Prograis in their light-welterweight bout in Manchester.

A bruising, see-saw encounter at Co-op Live saw Catterall knocked down in round five following a flurry of blows from Prograis ending with a heavy right jab to the jaw.

Both men then hit the canvas in the eighth round, grappling before tumbling and almost falling through the ropes in a bout that was occasionally chaotic but always watchable.

Catterall brought his best in round nine, twice sending Prograis to the floor with solid right strikes. The American received a count to eight on both occasions before resuming.

Following a nervous start, Catterall grew into the fight and gained control in the latter stages as Prograis desperately sought a knockout, twice sweeping himself off his own feet with attempted haymakers.

Nottingham: Hundreds dance at chip shop rave

Music fans gathered at a city centre fish bar as it transformed into a one-night rave venue. The menu at Nottingham's Lace Market Fish Bar is typically a variety of fish and chips, kebabs and burgers, but on Wednesday night it served up something different. In the first night of its kind for the chippy, it hosted local grime and garage MC Window Kid and British DJ Nathan Dawe. The floor shook as the event spilled on to the streets and staff said people could not wait for the next one.

The Window Kid from Arnold, known to friends as Greg, has been a regular customer of the Lace Market Fish Bar for years. ""It's my local chippy, and we thought it was a place where everyone's welcome,"" he said.

Firmative Media MC Window Kid and DJ and producer Nathan Dawe performed a new song

With 24 hours' notice, the micro-rave sold 35 tickets, but hundreds more attended, the MC said. ""It couldn't have gone any better. Everyone was just loving life; it was bang on,"" he added. The 30-year-old had played gigs in Nottingham since he was 18, so he was no stranger to a crowd, albeit in a slightly different setting. But for staff members Dorina Gjoshi and Sam Abbas, it was a night like no other at the fish bar.

Ms Gjoshi said she hoped the rave on Wednesday night would not be the last

""I was here serving drinks, and the floor was actually shaking,"" Ms Gjoshi said. The 35-year-old added: ""We've had quite special occasions like the playoffs and hockey finals, but not like this. ""It was a great night - something to remember.""

""Everyone was happy"", Mr Abbas said

Mr Abbas, 43, said it was an ""amazing night"". ""People are asking about [doing it] one more time. Maybe we will after New Year's,"" he added.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1365/live/b34796a0-92f9-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3653/live/8f1040a0-92ce-11ef-801b-35100c122e65.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8fd0/live/5ce1b480-92e0-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd01/live/2fdb0570-92ba-11ef-9eb1-ddc029b578ae.png.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0l5w4wg9o

BBC Marti Pellow's most successful song - as part of Scots band Wet Wet Wet - is 30 years old this year

Singer Marti Pellow has admitted that after 30 years, he doesn't hate singing the song kept him at the top of the charts for 15 weeks. Love Is All Around is a member of a very small club of hits that hogged the charts in the 1990s to the point many couldn't listen to them any more. The Wet Wet Wet singer admits his relationship with the song could be complicated, but he understands what it means to people. ""Love Is All Around was a freaky wee song in the same way the Bryan Adams song was and the Whitney Houston song was,"" he told Afternoons on BBC Radio Scotland.

James Watkins/BBC Marti Pellow is celebrating 30 years of Love Is All Around with a tour next year

He said: ""It was a song that stayed around in the charts for an enormous amount of time. ""Through the passage of time, the pendulum swings with it but when I meet people they say they fell in love to that song, their son was born to that song. ""And that's great pop music. So for me - I still love it. ""I don't think I'd get out of a building or a venue without singing that song."" The songs people loved - and then loved to hate, like Adams' (Everything I Do) I Do It For You and Houston's I Will Always Love You, were attached to hit films at the time. Wet Wet Wet were approached to record a song for the Richard Curtis rom-com Four Weddings And A Funeral. They turned down covers of I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor and Can't Smile Without You by Barry Manilow, opting for the Troggs hit. Pellow, now 59, remembers the first time he heard the tune.

""It was REM's interpretation of it that I knew,"" he said. ""Then I found out it was written by Reg Presley from the Troggs, lovely man. ""It just shows you that when a good song is written, everyone can have a shot at it."" Pellow grew up in Clydebank, near Glasgow, and became a part of Wet Wet Wet when the band were all teenagers. The band enjoyed massive success, catapulting Pellow into a heartthrob - a status that remains decades on. Between stints in and out of the band, he has continued making music, branching into West End and Broadway musicals including Chicago, Chess and The Witches of Eastwick. But it is the Wet Wet Wet hits that keep the fans coming back and he has announced a Love Is All Around celebration tour for 2025. He said he believed all the old hits would endure. ""The songs aren't about yesterday, they are about today and tomorrow."" he said. ""My idea is to celebrate the Wet Wet Wet songs - that's what people most associate me as a singer with - under the umbrella of Love Is All Around.""

Gwent Police Huw Orphan's wife Amy Burley said since the attack she ""can’t think of a day where I feel happy""

A police officer who broke his wife’s back after kicking her down stairs has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. PC Huw Orphan, 32, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court. He denied attacking Amy Burley, who also worked for Gwent Police, at their home in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2020, claiming he accidentally caught her with his leg after a row and was cleared of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Earlier this month, he was banned from joining any police force during a misconduct hearing by the Gwent force, which said he would have been dismissed immediately if he had not resigned shortly beforehand.

In an impact statement read to the court, Ms Burley said she had been left with frequent pain and mobility issues. ""I'm unable to sit or stand for a long period of time and I have a very poor and irregular sleep pattern,"" she said. ""I was unable to perform simple activities with my children, such as playing and having fun. ""After six months of sick leave, I went off on unpaid leave which has affected me and my family financially. I’m constantly drained by the whole thing.""

Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: ""This was a grave injury, as demonstrated not only by the injury itself, but by her personal statement, which shows she is still significantly affected more than four years after the incident."" The jury was told the couple met in 2017 while working for Gwent Police and got married two years later. They fought and argued often and had been arguing by text on the evening leading up to the assault.

cnn,A mom with a license plate that reads ‘PB4WEGO’ wins a battle with the state to keep it,['Alisha Ebrahimji'],2019-08-29 00:00:00,"CNN —

If you’re a parent, heading out the door before a car ride with the kids probably goes a little like this:

Parent: “Did you go to the bathroom?”

Child: “No, I don’t have to go.”

Parent: “Go now, you may not get the chance later.”

At least for one New Hampshire woman, that was pretty much the ongoing conversation she had with her four kids … so much that she made it her vanity license plate for 15 years.

Wendy Auger is proud of her “PB4WEGO” plate and told CNN she’s never had any issues with it. Until now.

New Hampshire asked Auger, in a letter she received August 16, to surrender her plate because it includes a phrase relating to “sexual or excretory acts or functions,” said Auger.

I’m not a political activist,” she said. “But this is a non-offensive thing that I’ve had and it’s part of who we are as a family and who I am and there was zero reason for them to take it away.”

The recall letter said Auger had 10 days to surrender her plate with the option to choose another vanity plate at no extra cost or have one assigned to her.

If Auger chose to get a regular plate, a portion of her vanity plate fee would be refunded to her, according to the letter.

After hearing about Auger’s situation from a mutual friend, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu got involved.

“Upon this being brought to my attention, I reached out to the Division of Motor Vehicles and strongly urged them to allow Wendy to keep the license plate she has had for the last 15 years,” Sununu told CNN in a statement.

“I recently left a message on her phone to share the good news that her plate will not be recalled.”

Auger said she was happy she got to keep a piece of who her family is with her.

cnn,Fernando Arroyos: 3 alleged gang members and an associate charged in killing off-duty LAPD officer,"['Mallika Kallingal Jenn Selva', 'Mallika Kallingal', 'Jenn Selva']",2022-01-14 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: (7/19/24) Since this story was published in January 2022, Rios, Contreras, and Cisneros pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Rios and Cisneros were both sentenced to 50 years in federal prison and Contreras was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison, according to the US Attorney’s Office. Grisham pleaded guilty to violent crime in aid of racketeering and is expected to be sentenced in September.

CNN —

Federal prosecutors charged three alleged gang members and one alleged gang associate Thursday in the fatal shooting of off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer Fernando Arroyos during an attempted robbery.

Luis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio’s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged.

According to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos’ neck.

There was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.

The four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole.

CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s office in an attempt to contact legal representation for the defendants and is awaiting a response.

Arroyos, 27, “was starting a very promising career,” LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday. He was with the department for three years and assigned to the Wilshire Division.

“He found himself, after working a series of days in patrol, to have a day off, enjoying it with his girlfriend on a hunt for a house, a place to live, a place to buy and invest in this city and the future of this region,” Moore said.

Arroyos is survived by his mother and stepfather.

“He was the only child, he had a promising future, a bright future that was taken away, viciously, over a street robbery,” the chief said.

F-13 is a “large, multi-generational street gang that previously has been the subject of federal prosecutions, including two large racketeering cases,” the US Attorney’s office said in a news release.

The news release did not mention any connection between Arroyos and the suspects.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220111154021-los-angeles-off-duty-officer-shooting.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220114014029-lapd-arroyos-incident-vigil-01122022-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220114014029-lapd-arroyos-incident-vigil-01122022-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/us/gang-members-charged-arroyo-shooting/index.html
cnn,What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed,['Forrest Brown'],2024-10-14 18:40:44.804000+00:00,"CNN —

Bad weather. Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled.

It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not).

Here’s some advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled.

Before you go to the airport

Check the status of your flight before you head to the airport. If your flight has been canceled, you could save yourself the hassle of a trip to a busy airport. Pattarisara Suvichanarakul/iStockphoto/Getty Images

As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.

“Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”

Other tips from Keyes:

Sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. Also, download your carrier’s app.

Put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the flight status that way.

Check the website FlightAware for larger flight trends across the country.

Hop on waiver offers ahead of bad weather quickly. Early birds have the best choices of the remaining seats and flights.

If you’re at the airport already

Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?

Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.

Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. It might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said.

Other tactics you can try:

Go to a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines and United Airlines advise.

Use social media to your advantage, the travel advice website Travel Lens suggests. Try contacting the airline via X or other platforms when calls aren’t going through.

Try an international call center for your carrier, Keyes suggests. Calls to US domestic numbers might have longer waits.

Attitude and research matter

Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference.

“Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”

He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”

Other considerations:

Book directly with an airline if the price is the same. If you’ve booked through a third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation.

Avoid layovers when booking if possible, the consumer advocacy group US PIRG suggests. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.

Regarding tarmac delays, airlines must provide working bathrooms the entire time, US PIRG says. “After two hours, you must have food and water. After three hours, you must be in the air or back in the airport – or the airline faces massive fines.”

Help from other airlines

Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.

“When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.

“This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”

Frequent flyer miles

Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of Points Path, told CNN Travel in an email

“You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them. But you could save yourself some significant cash if you’re trying to evacuate away from a storm,” Kheel said.

“Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.

“But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”

Trapped for the night

What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?

“Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely to do it there’s a weather issue, he said.

Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.

Other things to consider:

Book your flight with a credit card, Smith said: “Many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.”

Consider hunkering down at the airport rather than going to and from a hotel if your flight is delayed but not canceled. A lot depends on your personal comfort level and the estimated wait time, Keyes said.

Check whether there is a hotel room available within the airport.

Try getting into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily, the Points Guy advises.

Make safety your No. 1 priority. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous, Keyes warns.

Travel insurance and receipts

Consider buying travel insurance, advised Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel.

It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.”

The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1473420373.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1483116327.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2162032846.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1306865126.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1243272312.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240424090815-pete-buttigieg-04-24.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1247904515.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1245857533.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211227182241-01-flight-canceled-delayed.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html

Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

Last week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023.

Also, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021.

Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust’s chief economist, told CNN he is closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment.

“On a three-month average basis, it’s up about 200,000 people from last year,” Tilley said. “And that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.”

He added: “So when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer … that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.”

Still, other measures of layoff activity haven’t shown a worrisome spike.

US-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year’s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That’s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/77d6501e-6bfd-48f1-9210-79a06ca9ad34.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231030171043-nyse-10302023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/58730946-3a54-4c9c-979e-4ea033d7d8fe.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c0534e7c-1156-47b0-939e-f513f4f86ac5.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a61f55df-7353-4edf-add1-cd938a47403d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240508152421-biden-ebof-preview-sot-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/337f25e6-7272-4502-8814-e8d39399a6ad.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-june-07-05-24/index.html
cnn,24 of the best nude beaches around the world,['Joe Yogerst'],2018-05-24 09:20:54+00:00,"CNN —

2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.

Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It’s due to set sail in February 2025.

With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, “The Big Nude Boat” is billed as a “once in a lifetime experience” with amenities designed to “fit everyone’s style of bare cruising.”

And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area.

The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach.

“Nudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it’s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,” Tedeschi said. “It should be respected – so why not?”

Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.

From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it’s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.

“Soft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,” says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who’s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of “The World’s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.”

While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it’s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.

During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the “Adamic air bath” – his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of “the free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.”

Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.

One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a “free beach” movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.

And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:

Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay

Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay’s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.

Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand’s allure.

After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.

Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort.

Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania

The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe’s most picturesque spots to take it all off.

With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists’ colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.

Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.

Agesta Beach, Sweden

Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.

Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach’s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.

Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.

Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand

Although it’s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation’s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.

Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island’s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.

You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke’s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.

Nugal Beach, Croatia

Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Brač island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.

Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair — like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.

Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tučepi.

Perched at the island’s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).

Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.

Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island’s private nude beach.

Black’s Beach, La Jolla, California

Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State’s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.

Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego.

Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)

Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it’s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.

The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.

Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany

“Grin and bare it” might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).

Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.

It’s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.

Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada

Billed as one of the world’s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.

With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.

Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.

Red Beach, Crete, Greece

This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.

Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront.

Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni’s that’s renowned for its mojitos.

Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.

Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands

Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.

Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.

Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles.

Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe.

Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts

While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.)

Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.

L’Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over.

Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain

Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza’s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.

However nude sunbathers aren’t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you’ll see pacing in the background aren’t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.

Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii

Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn’t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible.

Part of Makena State Park on the island’s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.

Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.

Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets.

Sometimes called the “Naked City,” Cap d’Agde Naturist Village is the world’s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.

Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want – restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).

Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.

Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy

Situated along Sardinia’s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment.

The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years.

Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future.

“We have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,” Tedeschi told CNN. “And then we thought, let’s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.”

The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby.

South Africa’s only official nude beach – and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent – is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.

Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.

Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation.

Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico

Live your “Y Tu Mamá También” fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael García Bernal were shot on location.

Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn’t legal here.)

While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy.

Metsoke Dragot, Israel

Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.

Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour’s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline.

Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.

Praia Massarandupió, Bahia, Brazil

The string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.

A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.

Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy

Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think “Swept Away ” – the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertmüller.)

Adding to the beach’s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.

Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit.

The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.

Vecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia

Edged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.

Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it’s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section.

The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that’s a big hit with local residents.

Vecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia

Haulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida

The most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.

The clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.

Given the stellar weather in south Florida, there’s usually someone in the buff on any given day.

But the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.

cnn,Kate Moss’ rain boots at Glastonbury: A fashion moment to remember,['Oscar Holland'],2019-06-26 08:51:00+00:00,"Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “Remember When?” is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.

CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190626002527-file-kate-moss-03.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190626002535-file-kate-moss-01.jpg?q=x_2,y_153,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_800', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190625230548-kate-moss-split.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when/index.html
cnn,Case dismissed against teenage cousin of Uvalde school shooter for allegedly threatening school shooting,"['Ed Lavandera Joe Sutton', 'Ed Lavandera', 'Joe Sutton']",2023-08-08 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

cnn,The planet is getting hotter fast. This is what happens to your body in extreme heat,"['Christina Maxouris Antoinette Radford', 'Christina Maxouris', 'Antoinette Radford']",2023-07-09 00:00:00,"CNN —

Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.

Scientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis.

Climate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.

In the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels.

Here’s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.

What happens to your body

Normally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change – either lower or higher than that – it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University’s school of medicine.

“There are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,” Linden said. “The pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.”

The second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.

When you’re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn’t evaporate as easily – which pushes your body’s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.

“The higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,” Linden said.

High body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.

Types of heat-related illnesses

Mild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body’s salt and moisture and can lead to muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.

A heat rash can also develop. That’s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases.

When your body’s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what’s known as heat exhaustion.

“In this case you’re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You’re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,” Linden said.

“This is the body’s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.”

A heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.

“That’s where your body’s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,” Linden said.

Warning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC.

The hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.

“So when somebody’s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that’s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.”

Who is most at risk

Elderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.

The elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.

“Very young (people) as well, because they’re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they’re less likely to get out of the heat if they’re starting to feel overheated,” Linden said.

Student-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added.

“In this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,” Linden added.

How to stay safe

When your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.

First, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. “If somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,” Linden said. “That means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.”

Putting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.

“If you see anybody with any type of confusion, that’s an immediate red flag,” Linden added.

When it’s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities – especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.

Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink water – as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water – or more – an hour.

“If you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,” Linden said.

Try to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov. Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.

When you’re home, fans can help, but don’t rely on them as your only way of cooling down – while it may feel more comfortable, they won’t help prevent heat-related illness.

“If you’re in a super hot room, if you’ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you’ve got a fan, and you’re able to mist yourself … then fans can be helpful,” Linden said. “Fans are not foolproof.”

Finally, make sure you’re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends – especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/nasa-milton-timelapse-thumb-orig.png?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21016228-520-942-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/elephants.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-20992329-93-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21021132-0-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/milton-hunters-wide-thumb.png?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/wide-flood-thumb.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-tesla-fire-florida.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/asheville-building-floodwater.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21031967-10129-053-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230621101912-video-thumbnail-extreme-heat-explainer-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/videothumbnails/82439050-04597038-generated-thumbnail.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21029048-4883211-719-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230705104755-02-weather-heat-wave-0703-beijing.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/109936-fltornadomilton-10.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230621101912-video-thumbnail-extreme-heat-explainer-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/milton-residents-tornado-01.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241009-suarez-kaye-weir.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/09/health/what-happens-to-your-body-extreme-heat-xpn/index.html
cnn,Juneteenth flag meaning: Here’s what the symbols and colors represent,['Harmeet Kaur'],2022-06-17 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story was initially published in June 2020.

CNN —

On this holiday you might see another red, white and blue flag flying over state capitols and city buildings.

That banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States.

The flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.

The flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date “June 19, 1865” was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.

For more than two decades, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.

“This country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,” Haith said. “It (the idea for the design) just came through me.”

Designing the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here’s what each element of the flag represents.

The star

The white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.

For one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country’s last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free.

But the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states.

The burst

The bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star.

On the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land.

The arc

The curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans.

The colors

The red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.

June 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law.

And while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better – and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200617173631-02-juneteenth-flag.jpg?q=x_0,y_130,h_1406,w_2500,c_crop/w_800', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134331-20200618-juneteenth-flag-star.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180615124047-harmeet-kaur.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1440,w_2558,c_fill/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134536-20200618-juneteenth-flag-full.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200617173631-02-juneteenth-flag.jpg?q=x_0,y_130,h_1406,w_2500,c_crop/h_833,w_1480', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134444-20200618-juneteenth-flag-burst.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134509-20200618-juneteenth-flag-arc.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec/index.html
cnn,June 18 2024: US heat wave news,"['Antoinette Radford Elise Hammond Maureen Chowdhury Aditi Sangal Mary Gilbert Eric Zerkel Elizabeth Wolfe Ritu Prasad Christina Zdanowicz', 'Antoinette Radford', 'Elise Hammond', 'Maureen Chowdhury', 'Aditi Sangal', 'Mary Gilbert', 'Eric Zerkel', 'Elizabeth Wolfe', 'Ritu Prasad', 'Christina Zdanowicz']",2024-06-18 12:04:26+00:00,"Advocacy groups are petitioning Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to include extreme heat and wildfire smoke as major disasters in the same way they do for hurricanes and other major disasters and emergencies.

Extreme heat is by far the most deadly kind of weather, killing on average more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to data tracked by the National Weather Service.

But as CNN as previously reported, FEMA’s hands are tied by congress and the Stafford Act — the federal law that gives FEMA the power to respond to emergencies and determines what qualifies as one.

The 77-page petition, signed by 31 labor unions, public health organizations and environmental organizations, was sent to FEMA Monday proposing an amendment to the Stafford Act that would add extreme heat and wildfire smoke to the definition of major disasters.

“This simple but elegant amendment serves to unlock critical funds for state, Tribal, and local governments and communities to manage and mitigate extreme heat and wildfire smoke—both natural catastrophes predicted to worsen in duration, frequency, and severity due to the climate emergency,” the petition says.

The petition notes that the Stafford Act can be easily amended as it was just a few years ago to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Around two dozen large wildfires are currently burning in the US, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, all of them in Western states. On the other side of the country, a dangerous, long-duration heat wave is tightening its grip on the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. About 270 million people could see temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week.

Despite the attention Tuesday’s hearing about Boeing’s safety problems will garner, it’s not clear whether it will produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm.

“Nothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,” Aboulafia said. “I’m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what’s bad.”

Calhoun announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Calhoun said he has a preferred candidate but he has not publicly identified that person and said the decision is up to the search committee and Boeing’s board.

Aboulafia said the board has shown little indication of seeing a need to change the way things are done at Boeing, calling it a “board on autopilot.” The board approved a $32.8 million pay package for Calhoun in 2023, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. And it could have been a lot more: He declined to accept his annual incentive bonus of $2.8 million – a request the board said he made after the Alaska Air incident.

At the end of the hearing Tuesday Calhoun pointed out that there have been changes among Boeing top mangers since the two fatal crashes and the grounding of the Max in 2019 and 2020, as well as additional management changes since the Alaska Air incident.

He defended using internal candidates from Boeing to fill the open positions.

“We try to select people who know a lot about airplanes,” he said.

But Senator Richard Blumenthal, the chairman of the subcommittee, argued that Boeing needed to turn to outsiders to make a true change in the culture at the company.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cd6775f7-15a7-4f25-8aa1-677c38d3bc34.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a5944201-c09e-4643-acf0-76b59797b292.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7af099a0-7406-4088-a0bc-4a90c76ed106.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/94df600e-92ed-4aed-8565-72449ddf5147.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/385a83f8-351c-4b33-b622-9da6fba242ab.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5134816f-ddd4-4af3-9da2-a7ce683d5280.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/666e5f97-a94f-4d37-9615-307fb54d72da.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8cbea299-e0f8-4581-8b42-e9c0bc879503.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5cd4d7a2-cab3-41f3-bfc6-dbe2f94562ec.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d9677299-1d77-4cd4-a172-5dc3c6f4303c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/fbdb3b6a-fd87-4d83-8139-2041dcecdfb9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240617223707-david-calhoun-061724.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240320155853-boeing.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c8093621-9dfd-42a9-97c0-487fd1393afd.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ac8633dc-e7a7-4f3a-b882-ba827a1c89d0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5d40813f-0f71-4419-b954-ac1379566a42.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1d8193ca-85fc-4e94-8bcf-801ae3ead763.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1746fcd3-0a66-458e-8302-d606ed665946.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/600dd1ba-cf70-4df4-aff5-6f007fabf5dd.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/aaae0c42-6831-4514-8812-29f8ea581ad2.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8c2010e9-cff9-45a2-a8a4-e40fab1f2d40.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/24b115df-54ea-4cc7-b367-f0ff965a551b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc952537-36e9-4205-a405-635fbaeb3647.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec937cd0-203d-45d6-a93f-091cbaef1020.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/27e048b1-f3ce-4775-a468-1d2d6d5f3a3b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/65dc6f6c-cf7e-4839-9fdb-969a03ca46a6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/boeing-ceo-testify-senate/index.html

Nathan Frandino/Reuters

Israel says it has introduced a daily “tactical pause” of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, but said there will be no let up in fighting in and around Rafah in southern Gaza.

The pauses began on Saturday and will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northward, the Israel Defense Forces said.

Soon after announcing the move, the Israeli military said “the fighting in Rafah continues,” adding “there is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.”

A bottleneck of aid has built up at Kerem Shalom amid Israeli airstrikes and fighting in much of southern Gaza.

Dire humanitarian crisis: Human rights groups have described “unspeakable” living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment. Israel’s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies.

More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a post on X on Saturday.

Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah, saying Hamas fighters are embedded in civilian areas of the enclave’s southernmost city.

The operation has led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Gazans say they have been bombed even when they evacuated to areas that were supposed to be safe — and that they have nowhere left to go. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles).

Israeli leadership criticizes the move: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard of the plan, according to an Israeli official.

Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said this was unacceptable, until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue. It raises the question of where the “tactical pause” order originated, but it’s expected to continue.

Israeli security minister Ben Gvir — a leading right-wing member of the country’s cabinet — condemned the pause. “Whoever decided on a ‘tactical pause’ for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is an evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,” he said.

Fighting and deadly strikes: Fierce fighting and airstrikes have rocked Rafah as the Israeli effort to destroy Hamas in Gaza continues. A civil defense official in the enclave told CNN heavy clashes were ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah on Sunday.

Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of Rafah Civil Defense, said the organization had received pleas to collect bodies and wounded people, but it was difficult for crews to access many areas due to Israeli military operations.

On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7e35de78-c605-475c-b6a2-827ca2a3ed8e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/71b72696-effb-4d20-8774-f2629dafb998.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e1385282-e884-423b-bc49-a45f94fbd4ea.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d8b18448-0a9e-4aaf-bed4-b69b004cafce.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bdf6f91f-4e72-426b-b4b2-e6da23684d97.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4b7b3691-34d0-42f0-807a-0071c6e61da5.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e77ed5ad-7d51-4704-8e8e-96c24733a818.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d3371237-5042-4d09-a5f4-07137ef01645.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a868bc28-632f-4b0d-aecf-90ccf95e7fb6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7f63d172-8d31-476f-8174-f7d0fe0e94fe.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cd6e6899-b70a-4de9-b50a-923203af7208.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240606153030-20-week-in-photos-060624.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5adec99e-37df-4b29-8612-60dce524f518.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2f1ed58d-e754-440b-bb7e-a6fd4a8f9b2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/55f4c101-ea95-4b9a-a219-11de10069e81.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9da8b69c-f941-40eb-98d2-e8bb96e7b9e5.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612111752-jomana-overwrite.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-17-24/index.html
cnn,Confessions of a 1980s flight attendant,['Jacopo Prisco'],2022-06-09 10:47:46+00:00,"CNN —

“I came of age when the jet age came of age,” says Ann Hood, an American novelist and New York Times best-selling author, whose book “Fly Girl” is a memoir of her adventurous years as a TWA flight attendant, right at the end of the Golden Age of air travel.

As a child, growing up in Virginia, she witnessed the first flight of the Boeing 707 – which ushered in the era of passenger jet travel – and watched Dulles airport being built.

At the age of 11, after she moved back to her native Rhode Island with her family, she read a 1964 book titled “How to become an airline stewardess,” and her mind was made up.

“Although it was sexist as hell, it enticed me because it talked about having a job that allowed you to see the world and I thought, well, that might work.”

When she graduated from college, in 1978, Hood started sending job applications to airlines. “I think 1978 was a really interesting year, because many of the women I went to college with had one foot in old ideas and stereotypes, and the other foot in the future. It was kind of a confusing time for young women.”

“Flight attendant” was a newly minted term, a gender neutral upgrade from “hostesses” and “stewardesses,” and deregulation of the airline industry was around the corner, ready to shake things up.

But for the most part, flying was still glamorous and sophisticated and flight attendants were still “beautiful and sexy ornaments,” as Hood puts it, although they were already fighting for women’s rights and against discrimination.

The stereotype of stewardesses in miniskirts flirting with male passengers still endured, popularized by books like “Coffee, tea, or me? The uninhibited memoirs of two airline stewardesses” – published as factual in 1967, but later revealed to have been written by Donald Bain, an American Airlines PR executive.

Some of the worst requirements to be hired as a flight attendant – such as age restrictions and losing the job in case of marriage or childbirth – had already been lifted, but others remained.

The most shocking one, perhaps, was the fact that women had to maintain the weight they had at the time of hiring.

“All airlines sent a chart with your application, you looked at your height and the maximum weight and if you did not fall within that, they wouldn’t even interview you,” says Hood. “But once you got hired, at least at TWA, you couldn’t go up to that maximum weight. You had to stay at your hiring weight, which in my case was about 15 pounds less than my maximum limit.

“My roommate got fired over this. The really terrible thing about it, other than what it did to women, is that this restriction was not removed until the 1990s.”

Hood was one of 560 flight attendants, out of 14,000 applicants, hired in 1978 by TWA, then a major carrier, acquired by American Airlines in 2001.

The job started with a few days of intense training in Kansas City, where cadet flight attendants would learn everything from aircraft part names to emergency medical procedures, as well as the safety protocols of seven different aircraft. The list included the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747.

“It was kind of terrifying, because it was so big – and the stairs, the spiral stairs that led to first class that you had to go up and down not infrequently,” says Hood. “I would keep thinking: don’t trip. Eventually I got used to it.”

Carving chateaubriand

Hood's favorite plane was a Lockheed L-1-11 TriStar. Christopher Deahr/Moment Editorial/Flickr Vision/Getty Images

She says her favorite plane to work on was the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. “Domestically, only Eastern Airlines and TWA flew it. It was a very approachable, workable widebody plane with a lovely setup of two seats on each side and then four seats in the middle, so everybody could get out easily. Nobody was unhappy on that plane.”

Flying was still glamorous at the time, she says.

“People dressed up to fly and remembered the food in a good way. It’s really different from today. I can only compare it to being in a fine hotel, or maybe on a cruise ship. Nothing was plastic and coach was super nice,” says Hood, who remembers donning her Ralph Lauren-designed uniform and carving chateaubriand cooked to taste for first class passengers, who also had a choice of Russian caviar and lobster bisque to go with their Dom Perignon.

It wasn’t all a bed of roses. Smoking on board was widespread, and for flight attendants it was a nightmare.

“If you went on a five-day trip, which wasn’t uncommon, you had to pack a separate whole uniform because you just would smell so much like smoke,” Hood says. “Boy, was I glad when that stopped. The front rows of each section were deemed non-smoking, but the whole plane was filled with smoke because you couldn’t keep it from going backwards, it was ridiculous.”

What about the Mile High Club? “It wasn’t uncommon on international flights to see a man go into the bathroom and a minute later his seatmate join him, or some version of that,” says Hood. “It didn’t happen on every flight, but you saw it.

“International flights usually weren’t as full as they are now, so in those middle sections of five seats on a 747 you could see a couple put the armrests up, take a blanket and disappear under it. I can’t say what they were doing, but it looked suspicious.”

As for passengers flirting or asking flight attendants out, it was also common. “I did date passengers, but that was mostly disastrous. It was never what I had imagined. But in 1982, I met a guy on a flight from San Francisco to New York. He was sitting in 47F – and I dated him for five years.”

An empowering job

Hood has seen her fair share of bizarre things on board. “The weirdest would definitely be the woman in first class who appeared to be breastfeeding her cat. I mean, I can’t say that it was actually happening, but she had her cat to her breast.

“And then the guy who flew the whole way in his tighty-whities and his dress shirt and tie, because he didn’t want to wrinkle his pants for a job interview. Or the guy on a 747 in Frankfurt who was riding his bicycle down the aisle,” she reveals.

That said, the routine would sometimes kick in, and not every flight was a wondrous concentrate of adventure and glamor.

“I would say the job was 80% fun and 20% boring. In some flights, especially those that weren’t very full, there was a lot of time to fill. You can only serve people so much food and so many drinks, and play so many movies. I made the job fun. I loved talking to people. I loved the feel of it. I still love flying today,” says Hood.

She says it was indeed possible to actually visit and experience the cities she traveled to. “Sometimes your layover was really short or you were just tired, but for the most part, the city was right out the door. I very much took advantage of that when flying internationally.”

She left the job to focus on her writing career in 1986, and by that time things had changed. Deregulation, which removed federal control over everything from fares to routes, had come fully into effect, changing flying forever.

Planes became filled with more seats and coach stopped being as pleasant, but flying was also democratized and made available to a far larger share of society.

Hood says she is proud of her career in the skies.

“Flight attendants are a force. They’re highly unionized. They’re independent. In the cabin, they make all the decisions. They have to troubleshoot. They’re there for the emergency stuff. They land in cities where they don’t know anything or anyone and find their way.

“It’s such an empowering job, yet it’s a sexist job. In itself, it is as contradictory today as the time in which I started it,” she says.

Nevertheless, she recommends it as a career option.

But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that “no one has an idea” how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group’s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal.

Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal – an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month – did not meet the group’s demands for an end to the war.

Hamdan told CNN that Hamas needed “a clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege … and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.”

Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified recently but appeared to grind to a halt Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it.

The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.

The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.

But the pledge is expected to be an “executive agreement,” the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.

Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he’d “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if Europe didn’t increase its defense funding.

The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine’s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said. An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine’s defense.

Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights said she felt “both relief and anger about this decision.” She said she was glad the decision had been rejected, but did not believe it should have made it to the Supreme Court in the first place.

Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project warned that while today seemed like a victory for reproductive rights, “we know that this is far from the end of the line.” Dalven said other politicians were prepared to pose challenges to abortion rights in the US.

Destiny Lopez, acting Co-CEO of the Guttmacher Institute said the case was “rooted in bad faith and lacking any basis in facts or science.” Lopez said it should not have ever reached the top. court, echoing Northup’s sentiment. She also warned that further challenges to anti-abortion rights would arise despite the outcome.

President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas said the decision from the Supreme Court “provides us with long-awaited relief.” Dantas said the findings meant “patients and clinicians across the country will continue to have access to mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management.”

The President of the American Medical Association (AMA) Bobby Mukkamala released a statement applauding the Supreme Court’s decision. “Efforts to second guess the FDA’s scientific judgment and roll back access to mifepristone were based on a sham case that not only lacked standing, but relied on speculative allegations and ideological assertions,” the statement said.

Phyllis Arthur, executive vice president and head of Healthcare Policy and Programs at BIO said they were pleased that the authority would remain with the FDA to approve new medicines. “Today’s decision ensures patients and drug developers can rely on the rigorous FDA approval process as the scientific and trusted standard for drug approvals.”

Meanwhile, Danco, the manufacturer of mifepristone, said it was pleased with the outcome of today’s ruling, which “safeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use.” The manufacturer said it remained committed to providing safe access to abortion across the US.

cnn,"What a medication abortion is like, according to a doctor",['Sandee Lamotte'],2023-01-06 00:00:00,"CNN —

Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill.

“While many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.

“A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,” he said.

Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation, which is “70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,” according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.

Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the “abortion pill,” which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.

“Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic — particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion — or because they have a preference for self-care,” said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman’s health.

What happens in a medication abortion

What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?

Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.

An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there’s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.

The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.

A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.

Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.

In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.

The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.

CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?

Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.

Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.

Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.

Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That’s something people could get without a prescription.

Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we’re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we’ve been doing more research on people’s experiences with medication abortion, it’s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.

CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?

Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It’s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies — and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.

People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization.

If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill.

Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful.

People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.

CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion?

Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever — 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit — that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider.

Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well.

One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it’s wise to be on the lookout.

We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends.

Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.

If someone still feels pregnant, isn’t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician.

People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230105123125-medication-abortion-process-wellness.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221012154304-01-abortion-doctor-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220922023331-04-ohio-abortion-092222.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230105123125-medication-abortion-process-wellness.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221222133043-01-jill-hartle-abortion-rights.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/health/medication-abortion-process-wellness/index.html

Reuters

Tensions at Israel’s northern border are again flaring, with Israel’s military reporting around 200 rockets being fired on Wednesday from Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said no injuries have been reported, with warning sirens sounding across towns near the border.

The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it was behind the attack, saying it was in support of Palestinian people in Gaza and in response to an Israeli attack on the village of Jouya in southern Lebanon, which reportedly killed a senior Hezbollah commander and three fighters.

The IDF said in return Israeli jets struck a rocket launcher in the Hanine area of southern Lebanon and militant infrastructure sites in the area of Yater, from which projectiles were fired at Israel on Wednesday morning.

Residents evacuate: Several houses in the village of Kadita in the Galilee region of northern Israel have been evacuated after rocket attacks from Lebanon caused fires in the area, according to Israeli police. Israeli officers have been assisting firefighters in evacuation efforts and closed a major east-west highway spanning much of northern Israel due to a nearby fire.

Attacks escalate: Israel announced last week that it was prepared for “very intense action” in the north as the exchanges of fire that have taken place almost daily since October 7 with Iran-backed Hezbollah ramp up.

The military capability of the Lebanese group is expansive, with the group boasting more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel’s defenses if an all-out war breaks out.

This post has been updated with additional figures from the Israeli military and evacuations.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/509cf76a-fccf-4340-a1fd-e53ead5c6299.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/55dd84fc-9b26-4623-8fb5-793b1b7ab10c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/774f0968-d368-4c95-9d68-d7cd8871bd9c.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6543deff-2205-4c88-82f9-97ce80d78f8b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/97e8f2fa-b54b-4b62-b5f4-3cf01a7d636e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/426217e0-a600-450f-a45d-d7c4d29579c8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240608142441-05-israeli-attack-central-gaza-060824.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/27e6a76a-d4e6-45ca-b7b2-e5e7daf784d1.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2968e3ef-e488-447c-bdfe-9c38bf24eeb9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e368e488-798b-4e28-a681-d50090923b6f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c45cb114-d666-44c2-bc19-0293e47b3859.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/950db37c-2303-4f90-b64e-0902abab7e27.jpeg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f37432cf-943e-41f8-a4ae-9d214298a894.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c896f4d-e05b-4d4c-89fa-52274262fc05.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8ee22890-11ed-4a8a-9528-423239c64178.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9bbf2bec-bf04-4942-a777-5de5dd3b91f6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612111752-jomana-overwrite.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/76f44349-3f03-4f90-a779-d33575746038.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-12-24-intl/index.html

The vote marks a major escalation in a monthslong dispute over the recordings between House Republicans and the executive branch that came after Biden asserted executive privilege over the files.

Holding the nation’s top law enforcement officer in contempt would build on Republican allegations that the Justice Department has been weaponized against conservatives, claims that have been particularly ratcheted up in the wake of former President Donald Trump’s conviction in New York for falsifying business records.

Through their subpoena fight with the Justice Department, House Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains stalled as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely.

House GOP leadership said Tuesday evening that they were confident they have the votes in their narrow majority to hold Garland in contempt, but they have been working behind the scenes to lock down their members ahead of Wednesday’s floor vote.

A handful of House Republicans have privately voiced concerns about supporting the contempt resolution, raising questions whether the conference with its narrow majority will have the votes to pass it, a source familiar told CNN. Still, House Republicans announced Tuesday evening that the vote would go forward Wednesday.

“We’re going to bring it up and pass it (on Wednesday),” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told CNN.

By a slim 208 to 207 margin, the House took a key procedural step Wednesday morning to pass the rule that will bring the contempt resolution to the floor for debate and a final passage vote later in the day.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c45f4a64-7aaf-446d-996e-faaa5e276fd8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1cceeb65-1c91-49f1-ae6f-00d8519dc132.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b155888d-916d-40c2-8998-a2ba5d0f8688.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240604115126-ls-merrick-garland-060424.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/14187e97-dfdf-4eb9-8fc0-f443b68e1fb3.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4c69b7ec-e4ec-4d29-bdeb-310b13401c86.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/24955473-9a3a-45e6-907f-d8374ad15956.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920151831-04-garland-testifies-0920.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/38c91425-fd5c-4c59-9386-7e0fdcc035d6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/737d88b0-9398-4fea-905e-fdada2da5b85.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/attorney-general-merrick-garland-contempt-06-12-24/index.html

Wall Street will be parsing the May Consumer Price Index report just hours before the Federal Reserve is slated to announce its monetary policy update.

The CPI report and Fed’s policy meeting have fallen on the same day just seven times since 2014, according to Bank of America.

Despite the rare event, it’s unlikely the stock market will swing widely because of the economic two-fer, some investors say.

“The things that could drive volatility higher would be if Chair Powell was to say something unexpected; I think that is of a very low probability,” wrote Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, in a Monday note. But if “inflation metrics come out much higher than expected, that could lead to a small sell-off. How much the market sells off would depend on how much above consensus inflation is running.”

The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold this month. Some analysts say upcoming CPI data won’t alter the Fed’s June decision, unless it shows a huge deceleration or acceleration in inflation. But the metric will still help guide the Fed’s decisions during the second half of the year.

“The number of rate cuts the Fed will actually be able to deliver this year will depend heavily on the outlook for inflation; if it remains stickier, investors may want to temper their expectations for easing for 2024,” wrote Glenmede’s investment strategy team in a Monday note.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9ac6a1df-d957-4e3c-8889-13db4cc9e762.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612092401-01-nyse-0611.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/867adb0c-6c66-495f-9b1a-a0f12c66d8e9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec642c48-8bfc-4827-aa90-43d6b776a66a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b73b2f36-a1d2-465c-a628-d76bcd70d1f8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/feec4cf3-a1ca-4ff6-a561-cef197801211.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/08a3b4af-9d27-418a-9acc-4becb48ad2dc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a8597e9e-6c0c-4e31-a5bb-3532efe077c1.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/95856bca-d2e0-4d48-bf26-2473bf344096.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bd3774cc-6c10-4e85-b463-987a41becb8d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1b45b7bd-f28a-4465-9838-f34847f39b91.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e37abf17-012d-4fd9-9637-c3fd3e9eca2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d2d27e83-3dcb-4d61-864e-9f9e4a3e0929.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20db003b-f123-450a-966a-4c5463457ff0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240508152421-biden-ebof-preview-sot-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1584d515-0ff6-4cdb-b6ff-7e6df181cad7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c4151498-80dc-4eef-8dce-1bdf21de1712.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/783cf0df-ec90-4c68-a877-fa32f04faf24.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a224879d-813f-4aed-b781-b1f623b70fec.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/823c36e4-36ed-45d6-8717-abdff7777112.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/86d60ca1-47f6-4361-a4eb-32c8122a4415.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f9ec0d1c-5aa9-4ea6-8e30-cfd07e0c5027.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b28255db-8d8b-4ff3-bf7e-6ac68bfc188f.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2d9bcc39-628d-481a-bd1b-99436a479866.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9f5ece4f-3144-4829-964e-41c03a28a788.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5fd093b6-ccef-4dab-a868-58f25e5b2f3d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c7bad47-5a33-4992-a2be-d0cf1330b70c.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/markets-fed-meeting-06-12-24/index.html

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

A panel of 12 Delaware citizens is deliberating in the the federal gun trial against Hunter Biden.

This is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.

Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.

The first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.

When a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.

These questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an “unlawful user of, or addicted to” illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, “No.”

Count 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It’s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.

“Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that’s the impetus behind these laws,” Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. “The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter … but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?”

If convicted on all three counts, the president’s son could face up to 25 years in prison.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5c574ed3-f9a3-43b1-b380-dd4a77abd455.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2b47f846-56c3-497c-8e32-27e2b4d07102.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/65ddf3b6-7550-4370-adcb-01b843c7b81f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f87401fc-417a-4d5a-aeef-3a9f85921262.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/17fda4da-1760-47a9-a9b9-a9f63e8ddf52.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/dd000a85-f16a-48f0-be24-ee659059cb03.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b09d1825-8996-4837-974d-fd44f2563756.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/62bf40cd-eed7-49df-b499-eca9df473945.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a72deb3c-313f-4f82-be88-facb2718e0ba.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/fb73312c-4ab0-42b5-9b01-260c68f9dac3.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8e7ea755-b371-49f3-ba28-1ed29b995925.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d24f8d8a-ead7-40ae-b302-d313b83cf649.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/00887097-f76f-45d3-b3ba-55292357f28f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/41348e59-f89f-48b7-af15-1c601b1de6e6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bf9f8c4e-462c-4f50-9f90-34d6fe8df0af.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f18e46ea-62f6-4b17-bcfa-0b88b246e0f1.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/848ea2a6-0790-4337-b109-7b550ee49e8c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/63c89be6-f269-4311-a42d-5d9bc0472b64.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b3218d75-bfa9-4825-8d96-6d771e8030e2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0eb732d2-2387-40dc-a7d4-edc5450b2474.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/624a59a2-1e5e-42d9-856a-01a6b3fb0982.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5992e016-d211-488e-82b4-45d4b7e6694a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-trial-06-11-24/index.html
cnn,As Equals: Frequently Asked Questions,[],2021-04-06 00:00:00,"What is As Equals?

There is a gendered dimension to every one of our major global challenges including, but not limited to: climate change, economic or health inequality, the rise of authoritarianism, mass migration or algorithmic bias. Critical, tenacious journalism is required to expose it all.

With stories on underreported issues in underreported parts of the world, told by underrepresented voices, As Equals intends to spotlight taboo subjects, use innovative presentations and effect change.

Staffed by a dedicated team, As Equals will broaden the scope of gender reporting and build on CNN's already-established reputation for independent, world-class, mobile-first, thought-provoking journalism, with production across CNN's platforms, including newsletters and audio, documentaries, as well as events.

How is As Equals funded?

As Equals originally launched in 2018 with the assistance of a year-long Innovation in Development Reporting grant from the European Journalism Centre. The series kept going after 2019 thanks to commitment by CNN.

In October 2020, CNN announced that the series would expand with a new three-year grant of US $3.6m from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

That money -- which can only be used by CNN for As Equals -- will fund salaries and associated staffing costs; the reporting and production of journalism in multiple formats; the commissioning of freelance storytellers and the holding of events.

For the duration of the series, CNN will continue to provide As Equals with staff and logistical support.

Will the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have any influence on CNN's journalism?

No. As Equals' journalism will be completely editorially independent. All of the output from the series will be held to CNN's high standards and will be fair, accurate and responsible.

As with other grant-funded journalism, we will regularly report to the funder, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to demonstrate that CNN is spending the money in line with the purpose for which it was intended.

How long does the funding last for?

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant funds As Equals for four years, until 31 December 2024.

Why focus on gender inequality?

As Equals intends to cast a spotlight on these issues and report on them in ways that deepens global understanding and produces tangible impact.

Will As Equals include trans people in its coverage?

As Equals is unreservedly committed to inclusivity. Our stories will not only show you what gender inequality looks like, but also how inequality is not just limited to one location or people, and why it persists around the world.

How can I contact As Equals?

You can send tips or questions to the following email address: asequals@cnn.com

Please note that we're a small team and get lots of correspondence so your patience is appreciated.

How can I contribute to As Equals?

As Equals does not cover the news of the day. Rather we attempt to set the news agenda through investigative work, or deepen understanding and knowledge of causes of gender inequality and potential solutions through engaging human-interest or data stories.

If you'd like to send us tips, or make us aware of insights from research, data from studies, or the names and contacts of phenomenal people whose stories you think we should tell, you can do so by emailing asequals@cnn.com

Every year we select a couple of themes in order to give our journalists and audiences the opportunity to cover an issue or trend from multiple perspectives -- and improve the potential for impact. Get in touch to find out what series we're currently working on.

Before you pitch us a story, we'd like for you to ask yourself a few questions first:

Is my idea original? This could mean that it could be a topic, a situation or a place that hasn't already been widely reported, but it can also mean that you have access to new information or different sources; your reporting will present the story in a new way, or will help audiences see the bigger picture. Am I the right person to tell this story? Do you have access that other people don't? Do you understand a complex issue and can clearly and engagingly tell a story about it? Do you study or follow a topic closely and can see what others have missed? Am I prepared to work with others? The best journalism is collaborative. You might have a great idea but not the right contacts or data skills, for example. If we commissioned you, would you be happy to work with a team to tell your story, if it needed it? How evergreen is my idea? While we will move quicker on columns, your opinion piece or feature idea shouldn't be irrelevant at the end of the day's news cycle. Is my story right for CNN? On As Equals, we want to see the bigger picture. To uncover the systemic causes of gender inequality and tell those stories for a global audience. Will your story help us do that? Is your story going to be relatable outside of its local or national context?

Does As Equals accept video or photo pitches?

As Equals seeks to amplify underrepresented voices in front of the lens and behind the camera. We're looking for character-driven short documentaries and photo essays by and/or about women and non-binary people across the globe, and would like to hear from non-fiction filmmakers, video and photo journalists who want to tell universal stories that touch audiences emotionally and hold up a mirror to society.

If you have an idea you'd like to pitch us, consider the questions mentioned above, then submit your pitch to asequals@cnn.com

While strong preference will be given to stories in pre- or early production, you may also include links to previously-filmed material.

cnn,"June 10, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","['Lauren Said-Moorhouse Jessie Gretener Antoinette Radford Elise Hammond Aditi Sangal', 'Lauren Said-Moorhouse', 'Jessie Gretener', 'Antoinette Radford', 'Elise Hammond', 'Aditi Sangal', ""Cnn'S Mariya Knight In Atlanta"", ""Cnn'S Benjamin Brown"", 'Allegra Goodwin', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore']",2024-06-10 09:02:06+00:00,"US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said an “enduring ceasefire” deal between Israel and Hamas is “the only credible path forward” after an Israeli hostage rescue mission that Gazan officials say killed at least 274 people.

“The best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say ‘yes’ to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted, which lays out a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the return of all hostages,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

US President Joe Biden unveiled the three-phase proposal late last month, saying Israel had submitted the plan, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments since have left some doubt over his level of support for the proposal as laid out by Biden.

Civilians in harm’s way: Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel’s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm’s way.

“The president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas,” he added.

Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution “where there’s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.”

US Sen. Tom Cotton also laid blame on Hamas for keeping hostages in civilian areas Sunday. “You shouldn’t take hostages in the first place. You should release them once you have, and you certainly shouldn’t hide them in civilian areas,” Cotton told Fox News.

The Arkansas Republican said the operation, which has drawn condemnation from regional leaders, was “heroic” and “well-executed.”

cnn,Apple Intelligence: AI introduced to products at WWDC event,"['Samantha Kelly Clare Duffy Brian Fung Aditi Sangal Michael Ballaban Paul Glader', 'Samantha Kelly', 'Clare Duffy', 'Brian Fung', 'Aditi Sangal', 'Michael Ballaban', 'Paul Glader', ""Cnn'S Clare Duffy"", ""Cnn'S Samantha Kelly"", ""Cnn'S Ramishah Maruf""]",2024-06-10 15:42:12+00:00,"From Apple

Monday’s keynote saw two big AI reveals from Apple: The unveiling of Apple Intelligence — the name for Apple’s proprietary suite of AI capabilities — as well as a partnership with OpenAI that will integrate ChatGPT into many Apple devices. Where does one end, and the other begin?

The key distinction appears to fall in the line between what Apple described as “world knowledge” and “personal context.” Where Apple Intelligence will excel is combining information about you and your relationships and using those insights to streamline your everyday workflows — calling up old photos from an event or helping you create stylized AI-generated images of your contacts. Much of the processing of this data will happen within the Apple ecosystem, either on your Apple device or in special cloud-based Apple servers.

By comparison, Apple’s integration with OpenAI will let you send specific queries about the wider world to ChatGPT. Apple said that while Apple Intelligence will understand a great deal about your personal life, other AI models — such as ChatGPT — may be better suited for responding to prompts related to more general information.

Any prompts to ChatGPT will be sent to the platform on an opt-in basis — users will have to make a conscious decision to do so. You’ll also be able to use ChatGPT to create documents from within some Apple apps.

From the sound of it, the partnership will simply create an easier way for Apple users to access ChatGPT rather than providing unique or distinct AI features to Apple devices. Notably, you’ll be able to use ChatGPT through Apple without creating a ChatGPT account, and any prompts sent to ChatGPT won’t be logged and your data won’t be stored, Apple said. The company added that it’s working on integrating other AI startups’ models, too.

So the two announcements could be seen as rather complementary.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c7069489-6a73-4b10-9893-420bd164302e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9d5d2148-b1b2-4ce8-9444-52965f613a3a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/12f29b41-4ed4-4ac0-9f50-a5cc56f3e124.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/00872589-ac93-4417-bbc2-4d5a2fb0b060.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c4f6b023-ea10-41e7-9140-0bab6eb5ee0a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/99e18226-7bf6-444e-b336-7c611faad743.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/12e9ed0b-2f3f-4541-a973-5ab457af89f3.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/3bb35247-2c21-4840-9b2f-fdfc80b37230.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/621c6163-a896-4b41-bda7-c71158777859.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/152fed08-32da-4153-8284-f16fc6c63efc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0ec07a71-417d-4ce9-a88f-944cb1a5ef2c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4763c937-d94c-4fd7-ba98-4c9ba20356b8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c8532e87-a8e7-464c-83e3-652385c04443.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240305171738-exp-apple-iphone-china-duffy-live-030503pseg2-cnni-business-00003501.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/66365245-263c-4b5f-b6c6-eb203dfc4739.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/537f5ee3-d83b-4fd7-9bd0-24dc723eeacf.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/05982298-e874-4706-9a42-9e5a370754be.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e84d123d-9e27-426c-9bb7-d178bd8945f7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ea39551a-d864-4190-b6d5-235e015bf4fc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5b3ca73d-1cc0-43cd-a4e8-2f583207c0ea.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/99cd8087-5cd6-459f-9d6b-32e0ed14938f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/923919b1-96f7-445e-9209-60f4668e66da.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/80395c1e-b282-4150-95bd-a410ae70d86c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c226fb75-55f9-42d7-a756-e41e9b871780.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c550faec-3c7a-420d-8ddb-f10f9595ded7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d96f0025-0d9b-4144-b89d-55942c6d5d55.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/78c2ed40-5949-4365-ba20-171d26e9d774.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240606165620-apple-nyc-live-story-card-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/02f24337-6ab9-43a6-b50d-912a0345aa73.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/apple-wwdc-keynote-06-10-24/index.html

Bill Hennessy

It was clear that speaking about her father was a very painful subject for Naomi Biden. And even though she is a graduate of Columbia Law School, she appeared very uncomfortable on the stand after the defense called her to testify Friday in the trial against Hunter Biden.

Naomi Biden entered the court on Friday with her husband, and first lady Jill Biden immediately motioned for him to come sit next to her among the Biden family and friends who make up at least the first two rows of the courtroom.

Naomi Biden’s testimony focused on two instances in 2018 when she saw her father.

The first was in August or September, when she went to visit her dad in Los Angeles. Hunter Biden had reached out to her to come visit him amid his stint in rehab. He offered to arrange the trip, and Naomi Biden said she agreed to go, even though she had not seen him in quite some time.

Naomi Biden said she met with him and his sober coach, and brought her boyfriend, who is now her husband. It was “the cleanest she had seen him since my uncle died,” Naomi Biden said.

“I was proud of him, and I was proud to introduce Peter to him,” she said.

On the stand, Naomi Biden came across as genuine and compelling as the child of an addict.

She then testified about a trip to New York City, where Hunter Biden came to pick up a car. She described seeing him at the end of October, and said she felt “hopeful.” Naomi Biden said her father seemed the same as when she had seen him in Los Angeles.

On cross-examination by prosecutor Leo Wise, she again testified about how she had not seen her father recently because “after my uncle died, things got bad,” around 2015.

Prosecutors got her to concede that she really did not know what he was like when he was using drugs, because she had not seen him for quite some time.

Prosecutors seemed to catch Naomi and defense attorney Abbe Lowell off guard when they introduced her to a series of texts she exchanged with her father during the trip to New York.

Naomi Biden seemed a little confused and reticent when confronted with texts appearing to show her father to be somewhat erratic and non-communicative when trying to arrange the hand off of his car.

She did not remember the exchange and started to appear increasingly uncomfortable when talking about texts her father sent her in the wee hours of the morning about exchanging his car.

As she left the stand, Naomi Biden gave her dad a cool embrace, a kiss on the cheek, and was seen trembling and wiping away tears as she exited the courtroom.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/58ca0933-7be6-4f3c-90c0-45fed4a6647e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ddec0ec0-fb4b-4759-9a2c-551ebf146b3f.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610201301-hunter-biden-women.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f2e90b17-24f6-4003-b3f7-9f5931811b94.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20eb055c-b8e5-41f8-a2d1-0e8bd38f13c0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6f755857-67f0-4772-a6b0-0a432e6f5afb.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec35b129-a6b1-411d-844b-89d3e1c883f2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e155d849-10fc-4adf-8518-a930f3d5b0d2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b3302384-5771-403f-8d7e-a021290aaba2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c443859-e6d3-47aa-ae5c-2f86c8bd3d20.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5c05062e-ca4e-4662-b11e-f7d77ef38b4c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2b6d8fec-36e6-4dbe-83ff-70312867fd2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-trial-06-10-24/index.html

“The best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say ‘yes’ to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted, which lays out a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the return of all hostages,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

US President Joe Biden unveiled the three-phase proposal late last month, saying Israel had submitted the plan, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments since have left some doubt over his level of support for the proposal as laid out by Biden.

Civilians in harm’s way: Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel’s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm’s way.

“The president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas,” he added.

Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution “where there’s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.”

US Sen. Tom Cotton also laid blame on Hamas for keeping hostages in civilian areas Sunday. “You shouldn’t take hostages in the first place. You should release them once you have, and you certainly shouldn’t hide them in civilian areas,” Cotton told Fox News.

The Arkansas Republican said the operation, which has drawn condemnation from regional leaders, was “heroic” and “well-executed.”

Europe’s drift to the right has been a long journey that’s seen the continent’s mainstream increasingly accommodate people with Euroskeptic views that were once fringe.

The projected gains for the hard right in the European parliamentary elections may seem modest in terms of pure numbers, but they are significant.

The results represent a major challenge to the pro-Europe mainstream officials who dominate the institutions of the European Union.

The advances chalked up by far-right parties may not be unexpected, and they don’t pose an existential crisis for the EU. But they show how the Euroskeptic right could, in the coming years, tighten its grip on the direction of the union.

Over the next 24 hours, the parties of the center – projected to remain the largest bloc in the European Parliament – will likely talk of a “grand coalition” to counter the rise of the far right. And while the far right is on course to make large gains, the center parties remain ahead.

On paper, these pro-EU parties can claim victory. On numbers alone, the centrist coalition has held. The center-right European People’s Party, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, and the liberal Renew Europe are the three largest groups in the European Parliament. When you throw the pro-Europe Greens into that, the center is by far the largest block.

nytimes,Trump Escalates Threats as Campaign Enters Dark Final Stretch,"['Lisa Lerer', 'Jess Bidgood']",2024-10-26 00:00:00,"A campaign marked by Donald J. Trump’s apocalyptic extremes has turned even darker in its final days.

With voting already underway in battleground states, the former president on Friday escalated his threats to prosecute and imprison a wide range of people involved in elections and politics. Hours later, on the hugely popular “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, he said that the “enemy within,” a phrase he has used to describe political opponents, poses a bigger threat to the nation than North Korea.

For eight years, Democrats have warned that Mr. Trump’s political ambitions have fueled some of the nation’s deepest divides. But in his third presidential bid, those worries have metastasized into fear that another term for Mr. Trump would threaten the founding principles of the Republic. As the campaign comes to a close, a series of people who know him well, including top military leaders and high-ranking former officials from his administration, have warned that Mr. Trump, who has sought to project his victory as all but assured, would rule as a dictator if given the chance.

Republicans say such concerns are overblown. But Vice President Kamala Harris has intensified her own alarms about Mr. Trump, switching the joyful tenor of the early days of her campaign to stark warnings that he would govern as an authoritarian and curtail what she casts as core American freedoms — like a woman’s right to terminate a life-threatening pregnancy. There are also hints that Mr. Trump’s dark promises are affecting the political choices of business leaders and media outlets owned by them.

For Mr. Trump, the personal stakes go beyond the outcome of what polls indicate is a dead heat. The former president is running not only for the White House but also to remain a free man. Should he lose, he may very well face jail time.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26pol-memo-dark-topart-gfjh/26pol-memo-dark-topart-gfjh-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-jess-bidgood/author-jess-bidgood-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/politics/author-lisa-lerer/author-lisa-lerer-thumbLarge-v3.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26pol-memo-dark-topart-gfjh/26pol-memo-dark-topart-gfjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-democracy-threats.html

Trump to power.

In her first appearance on the campaign trail during this election, Mrs. Obama, long reluctant to engage in the political arena, described the far-reaching consequences of the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, in the concrete terms of personal tragedy.

“If your wife is shivering and bleeding on the operating room table during a routine delivery gone bad, her pressure dropping as she loses more and more blood, or some unforeseen infection spreads and her doctors aren’t sure if they can act, you will be the one praying that it’s not too late,” Mrs. Obama said. “You will be the one pleading for somebody, anybody, to do something.”","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-mqkj/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-mqkj-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/nyregion/author-rebecca-davis-obrien/author-rebecca-davis-obrien-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-mqkj/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-mqkj-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/21/reader-center/author-nicholas-nehamas/author-nicholas-nehamas-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-bjlw/26election-live-harris-michelle-obama-bjlw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/harris-michelle-obama-michigan.html

The sites targeted by Israel, according to the officials, included defenses at the sprawling Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex, in Khuzestan Province; at the major economic port Bandar Imam Khomeini, adjacent to it; and at the Abadan oil refinery. Air-defense systems were also struck in Ilam Province, at the refinery for the gas field, called Tange Bijar, said the officials, one of them with Iran’s oil ministry.

The Iranian and Israeli officials familiar with the attacks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence.

Israel’s destruction of the air-defense systems has raised deep alarm in Iran, the three Iranian officials said, as critical energy and economic hubs are now vulnerable to future attacks if the cycle of retaliation between Iran and Israel continues.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26mideast-crisis-iran-attack/26mideast-promo-440am-et-jtlk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-ronen-bergman/author-ronen-bergman-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26mideast-crisis-iran-attack/26mideast-promo-440am-et-jtlk-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-air-defenses-iran-energy-sites.html

A California native and resident of Los Angeles, Ms. Harris was not only a unifying and inspiring generational figure, in the board members’ view, but also an important bulwark between Donald J. Trump and democratic institutions. They were unaware, however, that a different and more powerful group had been meeting — the family of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s owner — with far different plans for the newspaper’s voice.

This week, the biotech billionaire who had bought the paper in 2018 for $500 million acted on those plans with scant internal or public explanation, abruptly vetoing the planned endorsement, informing the board through an intermediary that The Los Angeles Times would make no recommendation in the presidential race.

For days, readers in overwhelmingly liberal Southern California speculated angrily about a decision that was widely regarded as a favor to Mr. Trump and a vote of no confidence in Ms. Harris.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/05/reader-center/author-shawn-hubler/author-shawn-hubler-thumbLarge-v3.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26nat-lat-01-ljfb/26nat-lat-01-ljfb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26nat-lat-01-ljfb/26nat-lat-01-ljfb-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/reader-center/author-soumya-karlamangla/author-soumya-karlamangla-thumbLarge-v2.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/los-angeles-times-endorsement-soon-shiong.html

Trump should not be called a “fascist” or compared to Adolf Hitler, a rejection of Democrats’ closing focus in the final days of the 2024 campaign on the eve of Mr. Trump’s rally in Midtown Manhattan.

The embattled mayor, who has been indicted on federal bribery and corruption charges, made the comments at a time when Mr. Trump has been trying to make inroads with Black voters, and especially Black men, in his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.

Ms. Harris has said in recent days that she agrees with Mr. Trump’s former White House chief of staff, Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, that the former president meets the definition of a fascist. Mr. Kelly also described Mr. Trump as offering praise for Hitler.

Mr. Adams, mayor of America’s largest city and one of the country’s most prominent Black elected officials, was briefing reporters about security plans ahead of Mr. Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden when he was asked if he believed the former president was a fascist.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26election-live-adams-fchk/26election-live-adams-fchk-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26election-live-adams-fchk/26election-live-adams-fchk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/17/reader-center/author-alyce-mcfadden/author-alyce-mcfadden-thumbLarge-v2.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-fascist-mayor-adams.html

“Eric Adams promised to be the mayor for communities like yours, and long before all of these corruption scandals, he has failed to do so,” Brad Lander, the city comptroller, said at the forum at a church in the Bronx. “Let’s be clear: You deserve a safer, more affordable, more livable and better-run city.”","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/nyregion/00adams-next-promo/00adams-next-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-emma-g-fitzsimmons/author-emma-g-fitzsimmons-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26mayor-forum3/26mayor-forum3-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26mayor-forum3/26mayor-forum3-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/mayor-democrats-adams-forum.html

But in early September, after heavy rains, a half-dozen officials stood overlooking the brimming reservoir, their feet squelching in the mud as they tried to reassure Nigerians that the dam was in good condition.

“The dam is not broken,” Alhaji Bukar Tijani, the government official leading the delegation, said that day. “People should not be afraid.”

Four days later, water ripped through the Alau dam wall, leaving two-thirds of the city of Maiduguri underwater, killing up to 1,000 people, said rescue and security workers, and displacing nearly half a million.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/world/africa/Nigeria-dam-video-2-promo/Nigeria-dam-video-2-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/world/africa/Nigeria-dam-video-2-promo/Nigeria-dam-video-2-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=='}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/africa/nigeria-dam-disaster-flood.html

But as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday, the party that has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955 is facing the possibility that it could lose its majority in the body’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives.

Just one month after a leadership vote by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party anointed Shigeru Ishiba as the new prime minister, the party entered the election under considerable pressure from a public angered by a long-simmering political finance scandal, rising inflation and the burdens of raising families.

That does not necessarily mean that Japanese voters are ready to hand the government to a divided and enfeebled political opposition, which last won a general election 15 years ago. Analysts said it was likely that the incumbent party would either eke out just enough seats to retain parliamentary power or would be forced to bring on new coalition partners to remain in charge.

nytimes,The Curious Case of a Temple Sweet: How Food Increasingly Divides India,['Pragati K.B.'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"It was a sensational charge in a country where food is yet another marker of political, religious and caste divides.

For centuries, the Tirupati temple in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has given laddu, a ball-shaped sweet, to devotees. The temple is the richest Hindu holy site in the world, with revenues each year of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is spending about a million dollars a month just on ghee to fry the laddu in, according to M.K. Jagadish, an official at a state-owned dairy.

Last month, the state’s newly elected chief minister, a Hindu named N. Chandrababu Naidu, accused his Christian predecessor of allowing the temple’s laddu to be made in ghee, a clarified butter, that was adulterated with other animal fats. A majority of the temple’s devotees are vegetarian; Mr. Naidu’s allegation called into question the sanctity of the temple itself.

The case of the temple sweet shows how India’s food cultures have become increasingly politicized. In a nation where cows are viewed as sacred by most Hindus, many states have banned the slaughter of cows and made the transportation of beef a punishable offense. In some, even the cooking of eggs has drawn official condemnation. Restaurants are closely monitored for any mixing of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food. Some states have ordered the owners of food stalls to display their names clearly so consumers are aware of their religious and caste identity.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/21/multimedia/00india-food-wpkb/00india-food-wpkb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/22/world/pragati-KB/pragati-KB-thumbLarge.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/21/multimedia/00india-food-wpkb/00india-food-wpkb-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/world/asia/india-temple-laddu.html

It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.

He is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.

Mid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.

Mr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers.

nytimes,The New York Times Editorial Board Endorses Kamala Harris for President - The New York Times,['The Editorial Board'],2024-09-30 00:00:00,"It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest. He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities — wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline — that he most lacks.

Those disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates.

This unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.

For this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/06/multimedia/30edboard1-pqmw/30edboard1-pqmw-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/06/multimedia/30edboard1-pqmw/30edboard1-pqmw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-2024-endorsement.html
nytimes,"Opinion | How Bad Do You Want It, Ladies?",['Maureen Dowd'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"Usually, I get political wisdom from Rahm Emanuel, not his brother Ari.

But a quote from Ari, the Hollywood macher, to Puck’s Matthew Belloni about the gender chasm in 2024 caught my eye.

“This election is gonna come down to probably 120,000 votes,” Ari said. “You probably have 60 percent of the male vote for Trump, and the female vote is 60-40 for Kamala. It’s a jump ball. We’re gonna find out who wants this more — men or women.”

Are we back to the days of Mars versus Venus? Or did we never leave?

It is the ultimate battle of the sexes in the most visceral of elections. Who will prevail? The women, especially young women, who are appalled at the cartoonish macho posturing and benighted stances of Donald Trump and his entourage? Or the men, including many young men, union men, Latino and Black men, who are drawn to Trump’s swaggering, bullying and insulting, seeing him as the reeling-backward antidote to shrinking male primacy.

Drilling into the primal yearnings of men and women — their priorities, identities, anger and frustration — makes this election even more fraught. When I wrote a book about gender in 2005, I assumed that, a couple of decades later, we’d all be living peacefully on the same planet. But no Cassandra, I. The sexual revolution intensified our muddle, leaving women in a tangle of dependence and independence in the 21st century. The more we imitated men, the more we realized how different we were.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dowd-fmwj/26dowd-fmwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dowd-fmwj/26dowd-fmwj-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/donald-trump-gender-election.html
nytimes,Opinion | The Risk of Trump’s Old Age,['Nicholas Kristof'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"What should we think as Donald Trump urges people to vote in January, confuses places and names, fumbles for words, simplifies his speech patterns, describes recent experiences that did not happen and in public seems increasingly vulgar, menacing and unfiltered?

When President Biden showed his age and stumbled through the June presidential debate, I was among the first commentators to call on him to withdraw from the race. So what about the 78-year-old Republican nominee? Frankly, I wavered about writing this column, for there is an unfortunate history, notably during Barry Goldwater’s run for president in 1964, of using quasi-medical language to undermine candidates one disapproves of. That is grounds for great caution. But if we’re trying to gauge a nominee’s fitness for office over the next four years, we also should acknowledge questions of Trump’s aging and capacity to do the job, as we did with Biden.

It’s unarguable that Trump is acting even more erratically than he has in the past. It’s also indisputable that Trump is at an age when many people see a physical or mental decline over the following four years. Perhaps one lesson from the Biden agonistes of this summer is that just as companies move C.E.O.s out before they struggle, we should be wary of electing elderly presidents from either party.

Let’s acknowledge the risks of armchair analysis at a distance and note that Trump still has physical vigor and a defense against suggestions of cognitive decline: For decades, he has behaved outrageously and sometimes been rewarded for it. And some people do not think Trump’s behavior is related to aging. Mark Esper, an honorable man who was Trump’s defense secretary and has criticized him as a “threat to democracy,” told me that Trump looks older to him but not obviously changed beyond that.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/multimedia/26kristof-cmjw/26kristof-cmjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/multimedia/26kristof-cmjw/26kristof-cmjw-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/trump-age-decline-behavior.html
nytimes,Opinion | This Is Not the Time to Give Up Wine,['Boris Fishman'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"Everywhere you look these days, people are turning away from alcohol. First there was Dry January. Now there’s Sober October. Who knows what month the rhyme scheme will come for next? Parched March? Modest August?

I admire these teetotalers. I too have abstained from liquor for extended periods and felt the clean poise and composure that replaces the low-grade hum of constant alcohol in the system. I met my wife during one such cleareyed abstention, so I know its value.

But I will not be joining the abstainers. I’m unwilling to part with wine.

It’s not because I’m chasing tipsiness — as someone who writes about wine, I often taste 50 to 60 glasses in a day, though I always spit them out and, in six years of drinking wine seriously, I haven’t once been drunk on it. But in a life that too often feels stripped of magic — whether because of our political hostility, the radical inequality in our society or the instantaneity required of everything — wine is a passport to transcendence. If water is life-giving, wine is psychedelic.

Sometimes, the aroma alone is enough to kick off the time travel. Last summer, my wife and I took our daughter to Istanbul. We visited Wayana, a wine bar that focuses on indigenous Turkish grapes, and I asked for a glass of Kalecik Karasi, the country’s flagship red varietal, which makes light-bodied, red-fruited reds sometimes compared with pinot noir. When I stuck my nose in the glass, however, I wasn’t in Burgundy. I wasn’t even in Istanbul. I was 6 years old, in my grandmother’s kitchen in Soviet Minsk, smelling the tart sweetness of her raspberry jam, made from berries we’d picked in the countryside, as it bubbled away on the stove, the sunlight streaming through the window. Then, necessarily, the transport was over — miraculous for being so fleeting.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/opinion/26fishman-image/26fishman-image-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/opinion/26fishman-image/26fishman-image-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/wine-sober-october.html

The woman, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant for the defendant, has been in Manhattan criminal court every day as scores of prospective jurors arrive for selection in a case that has divided New Yorkers from the moment the video of Mr. Penny holding the homeless man, Jordan Neely, on the subway floor ricocheted around the internet in May 2023.

However, Mr. Penny, who faces charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, is far from her most high-profile client.

nytimes,Top Law Firms Shrink From the Heat of the Mideast Conflict,['Ginia Bellafante'],2024-10-25 00:00:00,"Late in January, Katherine Franke, a prominent Columbia Law School professor and active supporter of the Palestinian cause, appeared on television to talk about a rally demanding divestment from Israel that had taken place on the steps of Low Library a few days before. What marked this protest from the many others erupting on campuses around the country last winter was the release of a putrid smelling vapor into the crowd by a group of counterprotesters. It soon came out that at least one of them was a student and former member of the Israel Defense Forces. The university suspended him.

Some students who had been sprayed with the strange emission were certain that it was “skunk water,” a chemical the I.D.F. deploys to subdue crowds in the West Bank. Speaking to The Columbia Spectator, the student newspaper, they described feeling sick afterward. Later, the student who had been an I.D.F soldier filed a lawsuit against Columbia claiming that his disciplinary proceedings had been “flawed, biased and deficient.” His lawyers argued that he had merely engaged in a “harmless expression” of speech by spritzing the protesters with foul “novelty sprays” — which Columbia, seven months later, acknowledged they were — “purchased on Amazon for $26.11.”

Discussing the episode on the left-leaning radio and television platform Democracy Now!, Ms. Franke said that she and others had long been concerned about older Israeli exchange students “coming right out of their military service” because they had been known to “harass” Palestinian students and others on campus.

From this observation followed a cascade of accusations and legal entanglements that have spread beyond the fractious world of the academy to illuminate some of the extreme steps that elite law firms have taken since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas to distance themselves from Palestinian sympathies.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/multimedia/author-ginia-bellafante/author-ginia-bellafante-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/nyregion/27Big-kqfc/25Big-kqfc-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/nyregion/27Big-kqfc/25Big-kqfc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/nyregion/columbia-university-kathleen-franke.html
nytimes,"Living on a Volcano’s Edge, Italians Practice for Disaster",['Elisabetta Povoledo'],2024-10-27 00:00:00,"A piercing alarm burst from millions of cellphones, a signal to hundreds of thousands of people to pack their bags and flee one of Europe’s most dangerous volcanoes. But most of the Italians who heard it shrugged.

It was around 5 o’clock on a Friday afternoon, and the alert wasn’t announcing a real crisis.

Instead, it was part of a four-day drill this month, coordinated by the Italian civil protection department, to prepare a densely populated area near Naples for the day its residents might face a host of volcanic perils: The ground buckling underfoot. Ribbons of toxic fumes. Exploding boils of molten rock.

The threat does not loom on the horizon, like nearby Mount Vesuvius to the east. Instead, an eight-mile-wide caldera — riddled with volcanoes — is recessed in the earth and sea west of Naples, forming what is called the Campi Flegrei, or “burning fields.”","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/21/multimedia/21vesuvius-dispatch01b-photo-qmzh/21vesuvius-dispatch01b-photo-qmzh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw==', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/21/multimedia/21vesuvius-dispatch01b-photo-qmzh/21vesuvius-dispatch01b-photo-qmzh-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/europe/naples-volcano-campi-flegrei-disaster-plan.html
nytimes,Crowds at the Row’s Sample Sale Beg a Question: Can It Stay Cool?,['Misty White Sidell'],2024-10-25 00:00:00,"What about the Row makes its take on a simple sweater that much better than a version by, say, the Gap?

The Row, a luxury label founded in 2006 by Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen, has become widely recognized — revered, even, by certain fashion writers — for its interpretations of wardrobe staples sold at big-box chains and high-end department stores alike.

It has also become known for the prices it charges for such items: $1,420 for a turtleneck, $990 for jeans, $1,490 for a pair of sneakers, $990 for silk-and-acetate hotel-style slippers. Those prices, along with the clothing’s unadorned nature, placed the Row among the brands emblematic of the trend known as quiet luxury, a form of cosplay associated with “old money” dress codes.

Occasionally, the Row will offer deep discounts on its products at sample sales, like one held this week at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan. Some people waited in line for as long as 15 hours to enter on Wednesday, the day the sale opened to the masses (an invitation-only preview was held on Tuesday). Others, like Samantha Braucht, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mother and content creator in New York City, paid line sitters hundreds of dollars to hold them a place in line.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/reader-center/author-misty-white-sidell/author-misty-white-sidell-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/24ROW-SAMPLE-SALE-01-pjkg/24ROW-SAMPLE-SALE-01-pjkg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/24ROW-SAMPLE-SALE-01-pjkg/24ROW-SAMPLE-SALE-01-pjkg-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/style/the-row-olsen-sample-sale.html
