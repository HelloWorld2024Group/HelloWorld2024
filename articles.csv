Israel’s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel’s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime.

Empty threats?

Iran’s official media in the hours before and after Israel’s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel’s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America’s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. ""I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,” he said. ""I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond."" Iran’s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey’s NTV network that ""any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.” Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: ""Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force."" It was, he said, ""highly misleading and baseless"" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran’s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence ""as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter"". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.

Deadly exchanges

Israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called ""axis of resistance"" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel’s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran’s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran’s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden’s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden’s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel’s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to ""take the win"" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden’s plan seemed to be working.

But since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran’s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah’s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel’s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza’s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It’s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel’s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.

Projectiles seen in sky over Tehran as Israel hits Iranian targets

Israeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran ""recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,"" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.

Tehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was ""limited damage"" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness ""to defend the state of Israel"". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be ""obliged to respond"".

The US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was ""targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm"" and suggested that was ""precisely what transpired"" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets ""in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against ""Iranian aggression"" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to ""de-escalate the situation across the region"". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed ""deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation"", while Jordan described the attack as a ""dangerous escalation"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation"". Iran's missile attack on Israel The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. ""It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,"" the agency quoted him as saying. ""Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it."" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a2b2/live/c2d37180-92f3-11ef-8828-f1bee45a8090.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/efb9/live/87c10a90-9365-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2741/live/47d59c30-9346-11ef-be3a-49936fa3c0db.png.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7006/live/2ff9d3a0-9360-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/efb9/live/87c10a90-9365-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f5bb/live/aebaef80-932e-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fae8/live/d9035860-9395-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr5ek4r8ro

Reuters

Commonwealth leaders have agreed the ""time has come"" for a conversation about reparations for the slave trade, despite the UK's desire to keep the subject off the agenda at a two-day summit in Samoa. A document signed by 56 heads of government, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, acknowledges calls for ""discussions on reparatory justice"" for the ""abhorrent"" transatlantic slave trade. The statement says it is time for a ""meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation"". Sir Keir said there had been no discussions about money at the meeting, and that the UK is ""very clear"" in its position that it would not pay reparations.

The UK has faced growing calls from Commonwealth leaders to apologise and pay reparations for the country’s historical role in the slave trade. Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as a result of slavery could take many forms, from financial to symbolic. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street had insisted the issue would not be on the agenda. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Sir Keir said Commonwealth leaders had a ""positive two days"" in Samoa and downplayed the prominence of reparations at the summit. ""The dominant theme of the two days has been resilience and climate,"" he said, adding that the section of the joint statement discussing reparations amounts to ""one paragraph in 20-something paragraphs"". ""None of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,"" he said. Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK would not pay reparations for slavery.

bbc,Chancellor set to hike employers' National Insurance at Budget,[],,"Employers' National Insurance hike to raise £20bn

Reuters

The chancellor is set to increase the National Insurance rate for employers to boost funding for public services including the NHS. Rachel Reeves is also expected to use Wednesday's Budget to lower the threshold for when employers start paying the tax - with the two measures combined to raise about £20bn. The move is thought to be the single largest revenue raiser of next week's Budget, with other tax rises expected, although Reeves is not likely to introduce the levy to employers' pensions contributions. Employers currently pay National Insurance of 13.8% on a worker's earnings above £175 a week.

A government source said: ""There is a universal consensus that the NHS needs more money. ""That means asking businesses to help out. The choice is investment versus decline."" At a news conference at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn on the detail of Wednesday's Budget. But he said the government would take ""tough decisions"" with the aim of putting the NHS ""back on its feet"". National Insurance contributions are the UK's second-largest revenue stream behind income tax. It is paid by workers and the self-employed on earnings and profits, and by employers on top of the wages they pay out. Speculation has been growing about the tax rises Labour will announce in its first Budget in almost 15 years, with the chancellor claiming there is a £22bn ""hole"" in the public finances. Other than National Insurance for employers, the freezing of income tax thresholds could be extended, meaning more people are ""dragged"" into paying tax, or higher rates of tax, as their wages rise and cross the unchanging thresholds. The government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, and changes to inheritance tax. Last week, Reeves signalled businesses would face an increase in National Insurance, when she said Labour's election pledge not to increase contributions on ""working people"" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. The chancellor is understood to have decided on all major measures to be announced in Wednesday's Budget and that the National Insurance rise has been earmarked for the NHS. Any changes to the tax can be introduced quickly, within weeks of a Budget, through digitalised payroll systems, meaning revenues can also be generated at speed. A two percentage point rise in National Insurance to take the employer rate to 15.8%, for example, would raise about £18bn a year according to published Treasury data. However, with Reeves also expected to change the threshold businesses start paying the levy, such a figure would probably be higher. The chancellor may face claims she is levying a tax on jobs, and breaking at least the spirit of the Labour manifesto. Sources however say she has resisted internal pressure to simply increase the amount employees pay in National Insurance, which was the party's specific election promise.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fa8c/live/1102f4f0-92bf-11ef-9eb1-ddc029b578ae.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71f/live/819c1280-9221-11ef-9347-4b3dd7fd1c89.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c759/live/09b1a6b0-91cf-11ef-936d-afed55fd5717.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3ba/live/812b0a80-92cc-11ef-801b-35100c122e65.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/19f1/live/b3bb2520-3ab6-11ef-b2fb-b1658f4bc7c2.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69cc/live/ed6ba380-9317-11ef-ac86-3d11e83b51f5.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/69cc/live/ed6ba380-9317-11ef-ac86-3d11e83b51f5.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wrkngvyx4o

The video shows the 55-year-old backbencher during the apparent disturbance in Frodsham, Cheshire

A video has emerged appearing to show MP Mike Amesbury shouting and swearing at a man who is lying on the pavement during an apparent disturbance in Cheshire. The Labour member for Runcorn and Helsby is seen pointing to the man and saying “you won’t threaten the MP ever again, will you?” in the early hours of Saturday in Frodsham town centre. It is not clear from the footage, which was apparently filmed by an onlooker, what happened in the moments beforehand. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said officers were called to reports of an assault and were examining the circumstances.

A Labour Party representative said: ""We are aware of an incident that took place last night. We understand that Mike Amesbury MP approached Cheshire Police to report what happened this morning himself and that he will cooperate with any inquiries they have."" Posting on his own Facebook page, the 55-year-old backbencher said: ""Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends. ""This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened. ""I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police.""

Cheshire Police said: “At 02.48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham. “A caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.” The footage, which has been shared widely on X, shows some people trying to calm Mr Amesbury down, although others can be heard expressing anger and expletives.

Earlier on Friday, Mr Amesbury posted on X about attending a meeting with local residents about community safety and policing. The politician, who has been a Labour MP in Cheshire since 2017, was also a shadow minister for local government when the party was in opposition. In July 2023, a 56-year-old man was convicted of stalking and harassing the MP at his constituency office and in Frodsham town centre. The court heard the offender had stared through the office glass, asked guards about their level of security, and followed and confronted Mr Amesbury on several occasions. At the time, Mr Amesbury said it had resulted in him feeling ""that little bit more anxious"".

bbc,Georgian election: Ruling party ahead in crucial vote on Europe,[],,"Georgia's ruling party leads pro-EU opposition in crucial vote - projection

Reuters The guiding force behind ruling party Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, was quick to claim victory

Georgia's ruling party is leading a pivotal election focused on the country's future path in Europe, an official projection says. The Georgian Dream party of billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili is on almost 53%, based on a projection of more than two-thirds of the vote counted, the central election commission says. The increasingly authoritarian party and four pro-EU opposition groups trying to end its 12 years in power had earlier both claimed victory based on competing exit polls. Georgians turned out in big numbers on Saturday in this South Caucasus state bordering Russia, and there were numerous reports of vote violations and violence outside polling stations.

One opposition official in a town south of the capital Tbilisi told the BBC that he was beaten up first by a local Georgian Dream councillor, and then ""another 10 men came and I didn’t know what was happening to me"". The opposition has described this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe or Russia. Many saw the vote as the most crucial since Georgians backed independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

Matthew Goddard/BBC Opposition official Azat Karimov, 35, was beaten up in the town of Marneuli

As soon as voting ended, an exit poll for pro-opposition TV channels gave Georgian Dream 40.9% of the vote, with the total for the combined four opposition groups put at 51.9%. But a poll for the big, government-supporting Imedi TV channel gave Georgian Dream 56%. Some time later, the central election commission (CEC) came out with the first projections. The CEC has come under criticism for being too close to the government and for rushing through electoral reform ahead of the election without sufficient consultation.

If the projection is confirmed, Georgian Dream will secure a majority in parliament, dashing the opposition's hope of security a coalition made up of four blocs. Under Georgia's new system of proportional representation, whoever wins half the vote wins half of the 150 seats. Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, told supporters it was a ""rare occasion in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation"". However, opposition leaders had a very different take. Tina Bokuchava of the biggest opposition party, the United National Movement said: ""We believe the Georgian public have voted clearly for a future at the heart of Europe and no amount of posturing will change that."" ""This is the moment. In future there may be no such moment,"" opposition voter Levan Benidze, 36, told the BBC. ""I know there are a lot of geopolitical risks - from Russia - but this could be the pivotal moment, a turning point.""

VANO SHLAMOV/AFP The leader of the biggest opposition party, Tina Bokuchava of the United National Movement, said the Georgian people and Europe had won

Although Georgia was made a candidate to join the European Union last December, that move has since been frozen by the EU because of ""democratic backsliding - in particular a Russian-style ""foreign influence"" law targeting groups receiving Western funding. The USSR may have ceased to exist more than three decades ago, but Moscow still considers much of the old Soviet empire its own backyard and Russia’s sphere of influence. It will have appreciated Georgian Dream’s campaign promise of a “pragmatic” Russia policy, not to mention Brussels’ decision earlier this year to halt Georgia’s EU accession process. Georgian Dream has promised voters they are still on course to join the EU, but it has also accused the opposition of helping the West to open a new front in Russia's war in Ukraine. Georgia's Russian neighbour still occupies 20% of its territory after a five-day war in 2008.

Bidzina Ivanishvili's rhetoric has become increasingly anti-Western, indicating that a fourth term for Georgian Dream might pull the country back into Russia's orbit. Georgians had a simple choice, the party's founder said after voting in Tbilisi: either a government that served them, or an opposition of ""foreign agents, who will carry out only the orders of a foreign country"". He has repeatedly spoken of a ""global war party"" pushing the opposition towards joining the war in Ukraine, with Georgian Dream (GD) cast as the party of peace.

bbc,Seven takeaways from Trump's interview with Joe Rogan,[],,"In three-hour Rogan interview, Trump reveals 'biggest mistake'

Reuters

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‘s three-hour interview with America’s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released. In the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the “biggest mistake” of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea’s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists. Two years ago Rogan described Trump as “an existential threat to democracy” and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk. The Republican’s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard.

Trump on his 'biggest mistake'

Trump told Rogan the “biggest mistake” of his 2017-21 presidency was “I picked a few people I shouldn’t have picked”. “Neocons or bad people or disloyal people,” he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy. “A guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,” Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had “fascist” tendencies. Trump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as “an idiot”, but useful at times. “He was good in a certain way,” said Trump. “He’s a nutjob. ""And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’ He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.”

Trump says he told Kim Jong-un 'go to the beach'

Trump said he got to know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “very well” despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.” “By the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,” Trump said. Trump said he urged Kim to stop building up his “substantial” weapons stockpile. “I said: ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy? Go to the beach, relax. “I said: ‘You’re always building nuclear, you don’t have to do it. Relax!’ I said: ‘Let’s build some condos on your shore.’” Trump also argued that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had been president. “I said, ‘Vladimir, you're not going in,’” he told Rogan, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I used to talk to him all the time. “I can't tell you what I told him, because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.” Trump said Putin invaded Ukraine because “number one, he doesn’t respect Biden at all”. The White House has previously accused Trump of cozying up to foreign autocrats.

On 2020 election -'I lost by, like, I didn’t lose'

Asked for proof to back up his false claims that the 2020 presidential was stolen from him by mass voter fraud, Trump told Rogan: “We’ll do it another time. “I would bring in papers that you would not believe, so many different papers. That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked.” Rogan pressed him for evidence. Trump alleged irregularities with the ballots in Wisconsin and that Democrats “used Covid to cheat”. “Are you going to present this [proof] ever?” asked Rogan. “Uh…,” said Trump before pivoting to talk about how 51 former intelligence agents aligned with Joe Biden had falsely suggested that stories about his son Hunter Biden’s laptop were Russian disinformation. “I lost by, like, I didn’t lose,” said Trump, quickly correcting himself.

Harris 'very low IQ'

Trump lashed out at his political opponents and praised his allies, many of whom are likely to appeal to Rogan’s fanbase. He called his rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, a “very low IQ person” and described California's Gavin Newsom as “one of the worst governors in the world”. Trump said that Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan’s podcast in the past, was “the greatest guy”. He also said he is ""completely"" committed to bringing Robert F Kennedy Jr into a potential new Trump administration. The former independent presidential candidate, who has a close friendship with Rogan, dropped out in August and endorsed the Republican nominee. Trump said he disagrees with Kennedy on environmental policy so would instead ask the vaccine critic to ""focus on health, do whatever you want"".

On extraterrestrial life

Trump said that he hadn’t ruled out there being life in space. “There’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” he said, referring to discussions he’d had with jet pilots who'd seen “very strange” things in the sky. “Well, Mars - we’ve had probes there, and rovers, and I don’t think there’s any life there,” Rogan said. “Maybe it’s life that we don’t know about,” said Trump.

On The Apprentice

Trump said that some senior figures at NBC had tried to talk him out of running for president to keep his show The Apprentice on air. ”They wanted me to stay,” he said. “All the top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it, because they wanted to have me extend.” Trump featured in 14 series of The Apprentice from 2004, but NBC cut ties with him after he launched his 2015 bid for the presidency, citing his “derogatory” comments about immigrants.

His health is ‘unbelievable’

Trump has been under pressure from Democrats to release his medical records after Harris released hers earlier this month, which concluded she was in ""excellent health"" and fit for the presidency. Trump’s team said at the time that his doctor described him as being in ""perfect and excellent health”, without sharing his records. Trump didn’t address the topic directly on Friday’s podcast. But he told Rogan that during one physical, for which he didn’t give a date, doctors had described his ability to run on a steep treadmill as “unbelievable”. ""I was never one that could, like, run on a treadmill. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper and the doctors said, it was at Walter Reed [hospital], they said: 'It’s unbelievable!' I’m telling you, I felt I could have gone all day.” But he said treadmills are “really boring” so he prefers to stay healthy by playing golf.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bad7/live/a4d487b0-9360-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9c41/live/42184480-8dad-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/736f/live/b86bf4a0-92ea-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0aac/live/ecbd8ed0-8b38-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f97a/live/3f5282f0-80b6-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ffa/live/702bf720-92ff-11ef-8528-d3c2d743fa9e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e457/live/d48d2d60-6f55-11ef-8c1a-df523ba43a9a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a225/live/51222100-8c9d-11ef-b6b0-c9af5f7f16e4.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2794/live/326830a0-9315-11ef-a741-5bc7ceeb685a.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b01/live/f70e4420-93ac-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29c0/live/df9eccb0-8fba-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/968c/live/bdc45be0-875f-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b8f/live/ea27ceb0-81f6-11ef-822c-a50726bfda2e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/718dfa10-93ad-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/15ed/live/a0385e30-81e4-11ef-ad45-893aa022fcbc.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a432/live/156b9020-92c8-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/51b4/live/18255fe0-90ce-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c43e/live/27ff6770-8085-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02ac/live/56120780-912e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e002/live/84c94730-938d-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d91/live/1b3c6bd0-93ab-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/678d/live/b4f07e60-9009-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96c8/live/e4a6a830-8d1d-11ef-81f8-1f28bcc5be15.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9d7/live/2eed7550-8b60-11ef-8936-1185f9e7d044.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a1af/live/7b758d00-93c0-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f01/live/7ee743e0-913e-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4039/live/bb2e0e70-8f53-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aeef/live/106ef7f0-8fc2-11ef-be67-d3b2237ffc84.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nn0913e8o
bbc,Afghanistan: Mum of killed soldier insists it 'wasn't a waste',[],,"'My soldier son's life was not a waste'

Kevin Shoesmith/BBC Angie Moore's son Pte Gregg Stone was killed on a rescue mission in Afghanistan

Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of the end of British combat operations in Afghanistan – a conflict in which 457 British servicemen and women were killed. BBC News spoke to the mother of Pte Gregg Stone, who was shot dead on a rescue mission in Helmand Province in June 2012. Weep for yourself, my man You'll never be what is in your heart Weep, little lion man You're not as brave as you were at the start. ""I had to fight back tears when I heard that song on the car radio yesterday,"" says Angie Moore. Her son Gregg Stone, 20, idolised Mumford & Sons, she explains. And the 2009 song, Little Lion Man, was a favourite. Gregg's big sister, Jennie, had booked tickets to see them in concert when he came home on leave from Helmand Province. Neither sibling would see the band. Gregg would also never hold his daughter. On 3 June 2012, Gregg, of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot and killed attempting to free an Afghan policeman who had been kidnapped by Taliban fighters. At the time of his death, his wife and childhood sweetheart, Samantha, was expecting their first child.

As the family tried to come to terms with the loss of Gregg, they endured further heartbreak when Jennie, 28, a mother-of-one, was killed in a car crash near Bridlington, in East Yorkshire, on 18 February 2013. Ms Moore, 68, searches for words to capture the enormity of the loss. ""It was a nightmare to lose Gregg, but then to lose Jennie eight months after, it was... unbelievable,"" she says. ""Every morning I used to wake up and think I'd dreamt it. Things would be different today. But things were never different. It was a nightmare and some days it still is. ""I still put this mask on. Some days it fits better than others. A record will come on and I'll think of them. ""There's all kind of triggers. Photographs. When I go places, I remember Jennie doing this, Gregg doing that. But luckily most of them are happy memories.""

Ms Moore brought up Gregg, Jennie and her four other children in Atwick, near the East Yorkshire seaside town of Hornsea, where Gregg's name is listed on the war memorial. She feels Afghanistan is being forgotten. ""People don't remember it,"" says Ms Moore. ""The world is forgetting."" She now lives near Scarborough, but still has a view of the North Sea. Outside is a bench dedicated to ""Jennie Wren"" – the family's pet name for her daughter – where Ms Moore often sits to reflect and allow memories from happier times to return. Indoors hang Pte Stone's Army dog tags – the identification discs he was wearing when he died. His Afghanistan medals and photographs sit on a cabinet, with a picture of a wren adorning a wall. ""Afghanistan changed us,"" confesses Ms Moore. ""We all became different people. Me especially. I became empty. Not whole. Like there's a part of me missing. ""It caused rifts. Some of them have been mended, some of them haven't. I suppose we like to blame it on other things but we all changed when we lost Gregg and Jennie. ""We're a jigsaw and there will always be a part missing. It will never be complete.""

Ten years ago, when the end of British combat operations was announced, a BBC poll found 68% of respondents thought involvement was not worthwhile. In August 2021, the Taliban regained control of the country after the US announced the final withdrawal of troops. Ms Moore listens to those who criticised sending British troops to Afghanistan. But she says: ""Gregg emailed me from Shaparak [a checkpoint in Nahr-e Saraj]. ""He said, 'Mum, if anyone tells you we shouldn't be here, take no notice. ""Gregg told me those people have a dreadful life. 'We're doing good', he told me. That was from the horse's mouth, so I won't let anyone tell me we shouldn't have been there.""

Ms Moore glances towards a clock on the wall, which displays a photograph of her son in uniform superimposed on to a union flag. It is the same image as the one that was issued at the time of his death. ""What hurts me is when people say it was a waste of time,"" she says. ""That's like saying my son died for nothing, that it was a waste of time his life being taken from him. ""It wasn't a waste of time. Maybe things have gone back and are not much better. But, for a time, they were. For a time, they made progress. ""My son's life was not a waste at all. He knew what he was doing. He knew why he was there."" The clock shows 11:00. Gregg is looking stern-faced. ""That really isn't Gregg,"" says Ms Moore, laughing. ""It's the only photo of Gregg I've seen where he isn't smiling."" It was the ""death photo"", she explains. ""All soldiers, before deploying, had their pictures taken, in the event of their death.""

bbc,Young drivers say AA's proposal to ban under-21 passengers is unfair,[],,"'It's my car - why should an under-21 not be allowed in it?'

BBC Faye Cullum disagrees with the AA's proposal to restrict passengers for young, newly qualified drivers

""Public transport is a nightmare,"" says 19-year-old Jack Pears - which is why he relies on a car. He says he needs it to pick up his younger sister from school in Swansea while his parents are at work. But he wouldn't have initially been able to do that if the AA got its way with a raft of new restrictions on young drivers like him. One of the proposals unveiled by the motoring body this week was to ban new drivers under 21 from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months after they pass their test. It comes after an inquest found the deaths of four teenage boys could have been avoided when their car careered off a road during a camping trip in Wales last year. While the government isn't thought to be considering the idea, it has got plenty of young people talking - many of whom say the proposals are unfair. Faye Cullum has been taking driving lessons designed for people aged under 17 and is excited by the prospect of using a car. ""If this rule came into place, it wouldn't give me any motivation to drive at all,"" says the 16-year-old from Norfolk. ""I want to drive because it gives me a lot more freedom."" She adds: ""If I'm paying for my car, the insurance and the tax - why should they be able to control who is allowed in it?"" Some are questioning why elderly drivers shouldn't face tougher rules too.

Older driver crashes on the rise

Department for Transport figures show that 4,959 people were killed or seriously injured in crashes last year involving drivers aged under 25 – a decrease of 60% since 2004. Meanwhile last year there were 3,451 such casualties in crashes involving drivers aged 70 or over – an increase of 12% over the same period. The intergenerational issue was brought to the fore on Tuesday when an inquiry ruled that 91-year-old Edith Duncan, who had dementia, was not fit to drive when she fatally hit three-year-old Xander Irvine in June 2020. The fatal accident inquiry called for drivers aged over 80 to take a cognitive test before their licence is renewed. Under current rules, those above 70 can renew their licence every three years though must declare any cognitive problems. If they don't they could be fined £1,000.

We put that point to the AA's president Edmund King - why call for more restrictions for younger motorists, but not elderly drivers too? He says the AA has already discussed some safety measures aimed at older drivers such as mandatory eye tests when they turn 70 and giving GPs more powers to flag risks to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). But, warning of social isolation if new rules deter older people from driving, he adds: ""The car is often a lifeline for an elderly person and they try and mitigate their fragility - they don't drive at night, they only drive short distances, et cetera."" ""It's a case of getting the balance right, as it is with younger drivers,"" he says.

'We're not all reckless drivers'

He also insists that some young people might feel relieved not having the peer-pressure of being a taxi service for their mates who can't drive. And some teenagers in Australia quite like similar restrictions that have already been brought in there, he says. ""Some of them in Australia said they actually prefer [having the rules] because it gives them the chance to build experience for six months by going out with their parents or other adults,"" he tells the BBC. ""So by the time their mates are all in the car, they are a more experienced driver."" Similar measures - known as graduated driving licensing (GDL) - already exist in Northern Ireland. In Canada, all new drivers face tougher rules regardless of age. Josh Jones, 18, thinks there is some sense behind the proposals. ""I think, in theory, it's a good idea,"" he says.

BBC

On Monday evening, Jonah Evans was relaxing on a train, watching a Netflix drama and completely unaware he was about to be involved in a fatal crash. ""The driver comes running through the doors and shouts ‘brace yourselves, brace yourselves, we're going to hit another train’,"" says the 25-year-old. He had just seconds to get into position before impact. ""I was thinking… ‘it’s been a good ride, it's been a good life’."" One passenger died, four were seriously injured and a further 11 people required hospital treatment following the crash.

The artist and graphic designer had just spent a weekend celebrating his birthday with friends in Bristol and was heading home to Borth, Ceredigion, when the crash happened at about 19:30 BST. He says that after his train hit a stationary one, everything felt like it was in slow motion. Passengers on the 18:31 westbound service from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth, were thrown from their seats. Mr Evans was uninjured, apart from whiplash. ""Seeing all those people upset was horrible... it kind of feels like a fever dream,"" he says.

""This one girl was really crying out, she was at a table seat and it proper hit her in the middle of her body and she started throwing up,"" he says. ""She started crying quite a lot... it was pretty horrendous."" He recalled seeing people around him with rib injuries, one person with a dislocated or broken arm and another person who had lost some teeth. Another passenger Bethan Evans, who was knocked unconscious on the same train as Mr Evans, recalled seeing waking up to find passengers ""flown out of their seats"".

""The last thing I remember is reading one of my books and looking at the time,"" she says. ""I saw a few people with broken bones and hearing emergency CPR being called and a lot of staff running down."" Anthony Hurford, who was on the other train - the 19:09 train from Machynlleth to Shrewsbury - found himself on the floor ""wondering what the hell had happened"". ""The word that keeps coming to my head is just brutal really,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Somehow my body bent the leg of a table and ripped it off its bolts attached to the wall. ""Suddenly I was on the floor with my laptop strewn ahead of me.""

Tudor Evans died following the incident

Tudor Evans, 66, from Capel Dewi in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, who was in the second carriage, died following the crash - which happened near the village of Llanbrynmair in Powys. On Thursday, his friend Iestyn Leyshon told the Newyddion S4C app that he and his wife had ""just begun to travel after years of work and then this tragedy happens"". The couple were returning from a holiday in Italy at the time of the crash. His family have thanked people for ""kind messages and support"", and asked for privacy.

How did the trains crash?

The crash happened on the Cambrian Line on a single track, close to a passing loop where opposite travelling trains can pass each other. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said initial evidence suggested the crash occurred at a speed of approximately 24 km/h (15 mph). It said it had deployed a team of inspectors to the site and on initial inspection found evidence that wheel to rail adhesion was relatively low, suggesting the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking. It said low adhesion would be an area of ongoing investigation. But what is low adhesion? ""That’s the jargony way of saying that the trains’ wheels are not gripping the top of the rail properly so you’re getting a sliding situation,"" says rail engineer and rail and transport writer Gareth Dennis.

""So if the brakes are being applied the train is just sliding along on top of the rail."" He says it could be caused by fallen leaves ""or sometimes you get very strange combinations of mist and rain that can end up creating a bit of an oily surface on top of the rail head and that’s extremely slippery"". “What will be interesting is understanding why we got to a situation where the rail was so slippery as a train hit another train,"" he says. ""We have systems in place to prevent that from happening and those haven’t worked so we need to understand why and that might require some introspection from the industry.""

How common are train crashes in the UK?

PA A full report into the crash is expected to take several months

“The reason rail incidents become big news like this is because they’re extremely rare events and that’s a good thing,"" says Mr Dennis. The National Rail website states that train travel ""remains one of the safest modes of transport in Great Britain"". One of the UK's most high-profile train accidents of last year was in September 2023, when the Flying Scotsman collided with stationary carriages at Aviemore Station in the Scottish Highlands, injuring two people. The last train crash in Wales happened in 1991 inside the Severn Tunnel, which allows travel between south-west England and south Wales. On 7 December, 1991, the 08:30 from London Paddington to Cardiff Central was stopped at a signal at the tunnel’s entrance. The train’s driver was advised of a signal failure and told to proceed with caution, but about three miles into the tunnel, it was rear-ended by a class 155 Sprinter travelling from Portsmouth to Cardiff. A total of 185 people were injured in the collision, five of whom were seriously hurt.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f99a/live/3a1ed870-92e9-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c588/live/42a46d30-92b6-11ef-ad0d-97efa3948541.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9417/live/6f084ff0-9094-11ef-aa31-750f828febf3.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4379/live/716b0670-92b5-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/93c4/live/aba8c060-92d4-11ef-bc92-3103a41424ac.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bcea/live/f48381d0-92c0-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.png.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3958/live/dd2ee140-92f3-11ef-8828-f1bee45a8090.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dcf2/live/82fbd0e0-92e2-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa2/live/c5d5dab0-92b4-11ef-ad0d-97efa3948541.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bf1/live/3085d790-920e-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ac43/live/25769b60-92e9-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac43/live/25769b60-92e9-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgejyn0p88yo
bbc,Can Rachel Reeves use her defining Budget to escape UK's 'doom loop'?,[],,"Can Rachel Reeves use her defining Budget to escape UK's 'doom loop'?

BBC

""This is it. This is what it’s all for."" In four days Rachel Reeves will stand outside No 11 holding the red Budget box up for hordes of press snappers. That moment really will be, as a prominent party figure suggested, a massive moment for Labour - and for the country. On Wednesday, the new government will reveal more about itself than ever before. We’ll know how much tax we’ll all pay, how much cash the government will spend and borrow, and the mighty financial markets will know in detail how the chancellor is changing the rules designed to prevent a public finance meltdown. “Budgets are a moment when the government actually has control,” one minister says. There have been deliberate warnings for months about how tight cash is - how No 11 needs to squeeze the public purse to make ends meet. But others in the Labour movement hope for much more than just a “Treasury budget” driven by balancing the books. They instead want a “Labour budget” - to seize the moment and prioritise public services. As one insider hopes, ""if you’re going to have a Labour government, let’s have a Labour government, not a Treasury government"". It’s a difficult balance, and the government’s attempt to seed expectations may have confused some of the public, a senior MP tells me. “Random members of the public reading it all think, ‘Oh gosh, life is collapsing, the socialist government is taking all our money,’ or you read something else and think, ‘it’s all going to be OK’.” You can read more about the plans we know about here, including Rachel Reeves’ big, planned announcement to change how the country’s enormous public debts are counted. But what will it add up to? What will Labour do with its moment of control?

A big bazooka Budget

The strapline of the Budget will be “fixing the foundations to deliver change” - not exactly the snappiest slogan in history. But ""fixing the foundations"" is fast becoming a very familiar mantra right across Labour, heard in soundbites, on social media, and in speeches galore - the government’s asking for patience from the public to sort out some deep-rooted problems in the country. And the scale of this Budget is likely to be huge. There is no doubt it will include a major set of measures amounting to billions and billions of pounds of extra tax rises like the hike in National Insurance for employers we’ve confirmed today; billions and billions of pounds of extra borrowing. A government source said: “It is a big budget because there is a hell of a lot to do to get finances back on firmer footing, and to make sure public services can keep going."" But note the ""to deliver change"" in the Budget strapline as an add on - a sign - that the chancellor is under pressure to spell out what the point of tax rises are, what the merits of squeezing some spending is. If you put up with the pain, what do you get in return? That pressure is behind the chancellor's decision to flex the spending rules she used to boast about being ""ironclad"". She wants billions to spend on roads, rail, to invest, in the hope of getting the economy growing – and extra spending on the health service and also, likely, for schools. We’ll hear more about that tomorrow with Education Secretary Bridget Philipson joining us on the show. As well as a big Budget in monetary terms, it’s a big moment in history too. The first Budget of a government with a gravity-defying majority. The first delivered by a female chancellor. And the first Labour Budget in 15 years.

Getty Images Rachel Reeves is set to deliver Labour’s first Budget in 14 years on October 30, outlining the party's vision for the UK’s economic future

A corrective Budget?

Aside from the huge price tag, there’s the purpose. The narrative inside government is that this is a “corrective” moment – essentially, cleaning up the damage done to the public finances by the pandemic, the energy shock, and what Labour would claim were damaging Tory decisions and “covering up” how bad things were in the run up to the summer’s General Election. As you’d expect, Conservatives would argue that the economy had started to turn for the better before they lost - but the independent OBR has said the extent of the problems had been masked. A ""corrective"" certainly sounds like something painful. Sources point to two previous Budgets after big moments of economic peril - the Norman Lamont Budget of 1993 after the disaster of Black Wednesday and George Osborne's 2010 emergency budget after the turmoil of the financial crisis. Both of those Budgets were notable for tax rises. This one won’t be different. Those ""corrections"", along with any big cheques that are written for health, schools or housing, will form the basis of Labour’s narrative. The message they want the public to hear is clear: things went badly wrong, and it's not going to be easy or cheap to fix them. Government sources even pitch this moment as a “last chance” after what they say are years of neglecting public services and running the country’s debt up to sort things out. Reeves will present it as a political choice, a conscious decision that contrasts to the Conservatives' record. ""Investment not decline... stability and an end to chaos."" One of her allies told me the Budget would be ""political, political, political"", choosing every opportunity to highlight the differences in her approach to the many Tory chancellors in her place before.

A political Budget?

That will be Reeves' argument – but how it lands with the party and public matters so much. And there are nerves in some quarters of the Labour Party, with some ministers very worried about how amount of cash they will have to spend. One senior source says, “no return to some form of austerity, that is the acid test – we all understand the inheritance, but there are different ways of raising money”. As with any Budget, as one MP says, ""we all have a shopping list"", and every squeeze on spending will have an accompanying howl of: how could you? Budgets can create new problems just as they can solve them. Skimping on the cash for hard-pressed local councils would cause alarm. Scrapping the £2 cap on bus fares would provoke outrage outside London. Raiding the research budget in the science department would cause upset. What about funding for the dental profession when the government is committed to 700,000 extra dental appointments? Every decision has potential pitfalls. A risk of upset, outrage - and even industrial action. A letter passed to the BBC from the Fire Brigades Union to Reeves is demanding a fair settlement for the Fire Service after years of pressure, dangling the possibility of industrial action if it doesn’t happen. There’s even a risk of strikes among pharmacies over funding, and the Royal College of Nurses has rejected ministers' pay offers so far. That's just a short pick of the very long list of dilemmas where money talks, and the chancellor’s been urged to listen.

‘Escape the doom loop’

Downing Street, both No 10 and 11, hope they can pull off a huge coup this week – to tell the public things will be hard for a while, but convince them that a better country is on the way; that higher taxes will be well spent, public services will get up off their knees, the economy will grow and we’ll all have a stake in it. There remain competing views about how to achieve that. Some are adamant that ""it will be the Labour Budget the whole country’s been waiting for... to escape the doom loop of high taxes, low growth and poor public services"". But even inside the party there’s scepticism about whether they can make it happen - a fear that No 11’s drive to balance the books, even with changed rules, will take over, preventing a bolder and cheerier message from ringing out at a huge moment. Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are fond of saying their number one priority is to grow the economy – and one source says it will not be “a Labour Budget or a Treasury budget, but a Rachel Reeves budget”. One senior figure fears that the “Treasury sees its number one mission as controlling public spending - not creating growth,” citing no difference between the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt and No 11 under Rachel Reeves. A Labour source says that “if it is a Treasury Budget, a technocrat one that focuses more on anything else on balancing the books, then it would be a let down”. Another jokes the plans are “52% Labour, 48% Treasury”, as the party has just been on the side of managing to stick to its political instincts, not the traditional money-saving drive of No 11. And what about the Budget tradition of a “rabbit out of the hat” - a nice surprise at the end of the statement? Not this time. I’m told a group of Labour staffers is eagerly holding a sweepstake about what it could be - but a source suggests, in a bleak financial situation, they stand to be sorely disappointed. “There won’t be any rabbit, it’d be like Watership Down for the poor little sod.”

Labour waited and worked a long time to get back into power. And Rachel Reeves has waited a long time for this moment, to give a Budget statement as chancellor in her dream job. The girl who saved her 20p holiday money, rather than spend it at the toy shop, now in deciding what to save and spend for us all. But the beginning of her and Sir Keir Starmer’s story in government has not been the one they dreamt of. This week is, according to a Labour source, “a golden opportunity to relaunch themselves”. Where the balance lands in Reeves’ big moment could hardly be more significant. Everyone in government understands as this source says: “We absolutely know it is the defining moment for the party and our government, this is it.”

bbc,Spanish anti-tourism sentiment shows no sign of flagging,[],,"'We are in danger' - Spanish anti-tourism spills into winter season

Reuters

It’s well past the August holiday peak, but anger against over-tourism in Spain is spilling into the off-season, as holiday-makers continue to seek winter sun. On Sunday locals in the Basque city of San Sebastian plan to take to the streets under the banner: “We are in danger; degrow tourism!” And in November anti-tourism protesters will gather in Seville. Thousands turned out last Sunday in the Canary Islands, so the problem is clearly not going away. This year appears to have marked a watershed for attitudes to tourism in Spain and many other parts of Europe, as the post-Covid travel boom has seen the industry equal and often surpass records set before the pandemic. Spain is expected to receive more than 90 million foreign visitors by the end of the year. The consultancy firm Braintrust estimates that the number of arrivals will rise to 115 million by 2040, well ahead of the current world leader, France.

'Tourists go home'

This year’s protests began in April, in the Canary Islands, and included a hunger strike by six protesters in Tenerife in an attempt to halt two major tourism projects on the island. They continued in many of the country’s most popular tourist destinations, such as the Balearic Islands, the Mediterranean city of Alicante, cities on the southern coast and Barcelona, where some protesters squirted foreign visitors with water pistols and shouted: “Tourists go home!”. The grievances driving the upcoming protests are similar to those in the summer. “Tourism, which for a few is the golden goose, is an economic model which is choking the rest of us,” said Bizilagunekin (or “with the neighbours”, in the Basque language), the civic association which is organising Sunday’s demonstration in San Sebastian. The protest is the culmination of a series of debates, talks and other events in the city called “October against touristification”. “What we’ve been seeing over the last eight or 10 years has been a huge acceleration of the process of ‘touristification’,” said Asier Basurto, a member of the platform. “All our city’s services have been put at the orders of the tourism industry.”

Reuters

He insists the numbers of arrivals themselves are not the problem, it is the way the city caters to visitors rather than residents. Public spaces are adapted for short-term visits and the tourism industry creates precarious jobs, he says. Mr Basurto believes tourists are pushing up rentals, largely because of short-stay accommodation, sending local residents further and further away from San Sebastian’s historic centre. “We’ve had a way of living for generations and generations – in which people are connected to each other and those who arrive are integrated,” he added. “If we have a model whereby people just visit for five days and then leave then it becomes a soulless theme park, without culture, without a community.” The complaint about tourism’s impact on rental rates is a common theme and feeds into a broader housing crisis across Spain. The country’s central bank has reported that nearly half of families who rent at market prices are at risk of poverty or social exclusion.

However, with tourism representing 13% of Spain’s GDP and directly providing around three million jobs, its supporters insist that the industry is essential to the economy and that it drove the country’s recovery in the wake of the pandemic. They are particularly concerned by scenes such as that on Playa de las Américas in Tenerife on October 20, where one video showed two tourists sunbathing on the beach while protesters chanted just metres away from them. There have also been reports in the Spanish media of more hostile behaviour, such as the locks of tourist apartments in Seville being covered in faeces. Such incidents prompted David Morales, head of tourism for the conservative People’s Party (PP) in the Canary Islands, to insist on “the right of tourists to enjoy their holidays without being the target of interruptions or gestural or verbal attacks, and certainly not physical attacks"".

'You are not my King': Moment King Charles is heckled by Australian politician

When an Aboriginal Australian senator loudly heckled King Charles moments after he delivered a speech in the nation’s Parliament House, it caught the world’s attention. Lidia Thorpe’s cries of “not my King” and “this is not your land” shone a light on a country that is still grappling with its colonial past. But in the debate that followed on the “appropriateness” of Thorpe’s protest, something else became clear: a split within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community itself. In the wake of an unsuccessful referendum which - had it passed - would have granted them constitutional recognition, the question many of Australia’s first inhabitants are now grappling with is how they should go about getting the self-determination they have fought so long for.

Indigenous Australians are classed as the oldest living culture on earth, and have inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years. But for more than 200 years - since the 1770 arrival of Captain James Cook and subsequent British settlement - they have endured long chapters of colonial violence, including the theft of their lands, livelihoods, and even children. As a result, today, they still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. But, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 4% of the national population, their struggles rarely translate into national voting issues, experts say. Last year’s Voice to Parliament referendum - which asked whether Australia should recognise its first inhabitants in the constitution and allow them a body to advise the parliament - was a key exception. The result was a resounding ‘No’, with one major analysis of the data suggesting many voters found the proposal divisive and ineffective.

EPA The Voice to Parliament proposal was decisively rejected in a referendum last year

And while the figures indicate a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic and “an easy way to fake progress”. But Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman and activist, says the ‘No’ outcome left most Indigenous Australians with “a sense of humiliation and rejection”. She adds that the debate itself - which saw countless examples of misinformation and disinformation - unleashed a wave of “racist rhetoric” that their communities are still recovering from. The big-picture impact of the Voice, Ms Baldwin-Roberts argues, has been a growing sentiment that traditional reconciliation efforts are “dead”. Those approaches have long tried to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through polite dialogue and education. It was against this backdrop that Thorpe made her protest in parliament. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t see you,” Ms Baldwin-Roberts tells the BBC. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t think that you deserve justice.” Ms Baldwin-Roberts says “new strategies” are needed to disrupt the status quo. She sees Thorpe’s protest as “incredibly brave” and reflective of conversations many First Nations people are having. “There are Indigenous communities around the country talking about our stolen children, our stolen histories - but she had access to that room. As an Australian senator she knows she’s going to get media, and it’s important to make this a talking point.”

EPA Australia Day - held on the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet arriving at Sydney Cove - has become an annual target of protests

Daniel Williams, who is of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, agreed. “After the [referendum] last year, what do Indigenous people have left? How can we find [an] audience with the monarch to effect change?” he asked a political panel on the ABC. “We're talking about 200 years of pain that is continuing to be unanswered and unresolved.” But others see it differently: there is a long history of Indigenous leaders petitioning the Royal Family to recognise their peoples’ struggle, but the independent’s senator’s act - for some - went too far. Nova Peris, a former senator who was the first Aboriginal woman in parliament, described it as an “embarrassing” move which didn’t “reflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large”. Both sides of parliament dismissed it as disrespectful and a failed attempt at grandstanding. Prof Tom Calma, a Kungarakan and Iwaidja man who was in the room, said it risked alienating “the other 96%” of Australia’s population who may not “see or understand the enduring impacts of colonisation”. “I don’t think the protest - the way that Senator Thorpe went about it - brings people along with us. And in the spirit of reconciliation, we need allies.”

bbc,What we know about Israel’s attack on Iran,[],,"What we know about Israel’s attack on Iran

Reuters

Israel has carried out what it described as “precise and targeted” airstrikes on Iran in retaliation for the barrage of missile strikes launched by Tehran against Israel earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of exchanges between the two countries that for months have sparked fears of an all-out regional war. But while Iran says Saturday's strikes against military sites killed four soldiers, early indications suggest the attacks were more limited than had been feared. Here’s what we know.

How did the attacks unfold?

Around 02:15 local time (22:45 GMT on Friday), Iranian media reported explosions in and around the capital, Tehran. Video uploaded to social media and verified by the BBC showed projectiles in the sky over the city, while residents in some areas reported hearing loud booms. Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it was carrying out “precise” strikes on “military targets” in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv. Just after 06:00 (03:00 GMT), the IDF said the strikes had concluded. The White House described the strikes as an “exercise of self-defence”. A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a ""targeted and proportional"" response.

What was the scale of the attacks?

The extent of the attacks - and the damage caused - remains unclear at this stage. The IDF said it hit around 20 targets, including missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air-missiles and other military sites. The Iranian military confirmed that two soldiers had died “while battling projectiles”. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were targeted. The country’s air defence said it had “successfully intercepted” the attacks, but that “some areas sustained limited damage”. BBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south. A senior US administration official said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities, targets President Joe Biden had urged Israel not to hit. Syrian state media also reported strikes on military sites in central and southern Syria, though Israel has not confirmed striking the country.

Why did Israel attack Iran?

Iran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with. In April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on an Iranian embassy compound in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to. Later, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment. In late September, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut. On October 1, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan. Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran?

What happens next?

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond. ""Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,"" the prime minister's spokesperson said. Still, early signs indicate this attack was not as serious as some had feared. The IDF said in a statement that ""we are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation"". A senior US official said ""this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran"". Iran’s foreign ministry said it was ""entitled and obligated to defend itself"" and described the attack as a violation of international law. But it also said that Tehran recognises its ""responsibilities towards regional peace and security"".

What is the situation in Iran?

Images published by Iranian state media show life continuing in relative normality - with busy streets, people exercising in parks, and fruit and vegetable markets open as usual. Iran closed its airspace for a few hours overnight, but it later reopened and there are several commercial flights in the air across the country. But there are signs the Iranian government are keen to play down the impact of the attacks. The IRGC has announced that it is a criminal offense to send “images or news” related to the attack to outlets that it deems ""Israel-affiliated"" or ""hostile”. Usually, Iran refers to Western media as hostile. Iranian media reported today that Tehran's Prosecutor Office has filed charges against an unnamed website for “covering issues counter to national security"".

Tinshui Yeung / BBC News The event was a sea of colour as fans dressed up to attend

Thousands of comic and gaming fans headed to London on Saturday for one of the most colourful days in the UK’s convention calendar. Fans flocked to the ExCeL centre for the UK's largest gaming, comic and pop culture convention, many of them dressed in elaborate costumes they had constructed themselves. The event, called MCM X EGX, also brought together hundreds of actors, artists and video game publishers who gave fans a sneak peak at upcoming projects. It was the first time the annual video games show had been combined with MCM - which runs Comic Con - meaning guests were treated to a wider range of activities, including lightsaber battles, costume contests and card game sessions.

Thomas Copeland / BBC News “I got up at 6am and spent two and a half hours putting this together,” Ellie, dressed as the Joker, told the BBC.

Organisers told the BBC more than 100,000 people attended the show, travelling from across the UK and beyond. On the multiple stages dotted around the expo, fans formed long queues to hear from over 700 panellists who were speaking. The venue’s two halls were filled with displays, stalls and gameplay areas, with more than 450 exhibitors booking places to demonstrate products or sell merchandise. But none of those numbers can capture the energy, passion and excitement of comics and games enthusiasts at the event, on what many told the BBC was the greatest day of the year. “My favourite part is meeting other people who are cosplaying,” said Catherine Mariah as she travelled to the event on Saturday morning. “By the end of the day you’ll be sad it’s all over - you’ll have the 'con blues'!”

Thomas Copeland / BBC News The showcase featured stalls promoting Batman, Captain America, and other comic book characters.

Tinshui Yeung / BBC News Several themed areas were set up around the convention halls, including this one known as The Farm.

Andrew Rogers / BBC News Professional Yu-Gi-Oh player James Tiffin celebrated the card game's 25th anniversary at the show.

Gamers were given hands-on time with new releases including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - the latest instalment in the hugely popular first-person shooter series. Fans also got a preview of Avowed - an expansive fantasy role-playing game from US developer Obsidian, which is due for release in February next year. Smaller projects were also on display, like the gesture-controlled indie game Jazzhands, developed by two University of Nottingham students at a 24-hour programming competition. But despite strong fan interest in the video game side of the expo, the gaming industry has been struggling. Several big brands pulled out of this year's show after job cuts and an industry strike hit US development schedules. Organisers at MCM X EGX may have hoped that combining EGX with Comic Con would keep the video games expo alive, while getting a bigger audience for the publishers who stuck with them.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1278/live/3e93aa90-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/00fb/live/1522de90-939d-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f10/live/aac069e0-939d-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9727/live/07d07d20-939c-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c043/live/267b9300-930f-11ef-a741-5bc7ceeb685a.png.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cdb3/live/db312950-939f-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f7e2/live/b1582170-93a3-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7096/live/339133f0-939c-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/80e2/live/ade3f210-92ce-11ef-801b-35100c122e65.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9343/live/def1ca40-8efe-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/66aa/live/78faf310-939f-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7096/live/339133f0-939c-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f968/live/107e5cc0-939d-11ef-aa01-c7eafd22a15a.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/72a7/live/7c7791e0-918a-11ef-99ad-7fb47f17a044.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ggry2ke9o

bbc,Tim Westwood: BBC warned by Metropolitan Police over report into allegations,[],,"BBC warned by Met over report into Westwood allegations

The Metropolitan Police has warned the BBC that parts of a report about Tim Westwood’s alleged misconduct may “interfere with justice” if published. The external review is to examine the BBC’s knowledge of, and response to, complaints, allegations and concerns about misconduct by the former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ. Mr Westwood has denied claims of misconduct, commenting: ""It's all false allegations."" The BBC declined to comment. In July, a spokesperson for the corporation said it was liaising with police to ensure that any steps taken - including publishing the report - do not have a ""negative impact"" on any ongoing police investigation.

""This is taking time,"" it added. Several women have accused the presenter of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in alleged incidents between 1992 and 2017, after a joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian. In August 2022, a review, led by Gemma White KC, was commissioned by the BBC to examine the near 20-year employment of Mr Westwood with the broadcaster.

It was initially believed the review would take around six months but a report is yet to be published. In a new statement to BBC News, a Met Police officer said: “We have seen the report and made recommendations to the BBC as to which sections of the report may interfere with justice if published."" BBC News understands the report is now due to be published within the next month. In June, the BBC said: ""This is an extremely important ongoing process, led by an independent reviewer. ""As we have said from the beginning, it is essential we fully understand what was known about concerns regarding Tim Westwood’s conduct during his time with the BBC and this remains the priority."" A freedom of information request by BBC News earlier this year revealed that the BBC has spent more than £3 million on the review so far. It is believed Mr Westwood has been interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police four times since the broadcast of the joint BBC News and Guardian investigation. In a statement, police said the offences are alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016. Detectives said they interviewed a 66-year-old man under caution last year. There has been no arrest.

bbc,Alexander McCartney: How police snared the catfish killer,[],,"Catching the catfish killer: Phone calls and 64 seized devices snared child sex abuser

PSNI Alexander McCartney has been jailed for life for his litany of crimes

It was a phone call from a 13-year-old girl in Scotland in 2019 that eventually led to the capture of a social media predator described as one of the world's most prolific child sex abusers. Alexander McCartney from Northern Ireland pretended to be a teenage girl to befriend, then abuse and blackmail children around the world, often sharing images with other paedophiles. Some of the children were as young as four. Some had never told anyone what they had been through - until police knocked on their door. McCartney gradually admitted 185 charges including manslaughter after a 12-year-old girl he was abusing took her own life. He has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years.

What did police do?

Following contact from police in Scotland, an urgent investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) swung into operation in March 2019. Detectives identified the home address of Alexander McCartney, arrested and interviewed him. Sixty-four of McCartney’s devices were seized at his home in the rural Lissummon Road area outside Newry in four separate raids. Those devices held hundreds of thousands of indecent photos and videos of underage girls performing sexual acts while being blackmailed. McCartney made and used many fake accounts on online platforms, mainly Snapchat, to entrap and manipulate them. PSNI Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan said McCartney had been ""offending on an industrial scale"". He groomed victims into thinking they were talking online to a girl of a similar age, before encouraging them to send indecent images or engage in sexual activity via webcam or a mobile phone. McCartney used the same pattern every time, the detective said, adding: ""He threatened to share these images online for the pleasure of other paedophiles and use them to further abuse and harass the already terrified and exploited children."" In one incident, it took McCartney just nine minutes to groom, sexually abuse and blackmail a girl of only 12 years of age.

Dale Thomas Cimarron Thomas was found by her nine-year-old sister after she had shot herself while online with McCartney

As time went on, it became clear that McCartney's depravity spanned not just across the UK, but across the world. The abuse included involving other people, family pets and objects. The PSNI worked with colleagues in the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Public Prosecution Service and National Crime Agency, and victims were located in America, New Zealand and at least 28 other countries. Many of these children were only identified through the evidence detectives located on McCartney’s devices. According to the police, he ""built a paedophile enterprise"" and had ""stolen childhoods"" of his victims.

Prosecutors hear about a catfisher

'Little girls were threatened in the most depraved way'

In the spring of 2019, police called Catherine Kierans, acting head of the Public Prosecution Service’s serious crime unit. They said something ""big was unfolding... it involved catfishing"". Catfishing is where a person creates a false identity to gain the trust of people and exploit them. Ms Kierans said little girls ""an average age of 10-12 years old [were] being threatened in the most depraved way."" She said some of the children who had been exploited had previously opened up about their abuse, others had remained silent. “Some of the children had raised the alarm, which helped police to actually identify him in the first place. ""But some of the children, until police knocked the door, they had never told anyone what they'd been through.” According to Ms Kierans, McCartney offended ""around the clock"".

Manslaughter - a precedent

Family handout Cimarron Thomas was just 12-years-old when she died

As the investigation spread across the globe, Ms Kierans said prosecutors realised McCartney had been ""very assiduous about saving the images"". ""He would also save the map on Snapchat of where the child was in some cases, and that then enabled police to locate the children.” His arraignment in 2021 was delayed as police discovered the suicide of a little girl in West Virginia, USA. “From the beginning, the level of abuse was so horrific that we were fearful that when these children were identified, would they be okay?” Ms Kierans said. “Unfortunately, our worst fears were realised when we discovered, some way in, that one of the little girls had taken her own life. “Working closely with the American authorities, we were able to prove that this child took her own life during the abuse, when she was still online with McCartney. ""At that point, the death of the child was so intrinsically linked to the abuse that we felt we had a strong case to say that he killed her.""

That little girl was 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas who, in 2018, shot herself while McCartney was abusing her. McCartney was charged with her manslaughter. Ms Kierans said it is believed to be the first time an abuser anywhere in the world has been held accountable for manslaughter where the victim and perpetrator have never met in person. Such was the magnitude of the case that prosecutors had to be judicious with the charges. “We couldn't put 3,000 charges on the indictment,” Ms Kierans said. “In the end, there were about 200 charges [relating to around 70 victims] which is probably one of the largest indictments that we've seen in Northern Ireland.""

Who is Alexander McCartney?

other McCartney attended Newry High School and was into gaming

McCartney grew up five miles outside of Newry and just off the main road to Armagh city. It’s about as rural as it gets. Farms, a church and a few businesses. When he first appeared at Newry Magistrates' Court in July 2019 he was just 21, with long, fuzzy hair and the wide-eyed look of someone surprised to be sitting where he was. He has spent more than five years on remand at Maghaberry Prison – leaving only for court appearances and further questioning by the police. In those hearings, he said little other than to confirm his name and date of birth and to gradually enter softly-spoken guilty pleas.

Some of the messages that McCartney sent to his victims on Snapchat

'Nothing extraordinary about him'

McCartney attended Newry High School and was into gaming. One source told BBC News NI: ""He was introverted and socially awkward. He didn’t interact with people much outside of his group of friends. ""He was maybe at the edges of things, but he had friends who obviously knew nothing about this."" He then took a course at the Southern Regional College in Newry where he was described as ""quiet and didn't really get involved with the rest of the class"". When he was eventually charged in 2019 he was a computer science student at Ulster University. For those living in and around his home, the case has been harrowing. “The whole place was stunned,” one resident said. “It was whispers at the start, then disbelief. I’m sure people talk about it in their own homes but it doesn’t get discussed publicly as people don’t know what to say."" Another said: “He came across as a pleasant, affable, intelligent young man. ""There is nothing extraordinary about him.”

But what is extraordinary is the enormity of his offending; many of his victims had pleaded for the abuse to stop but prosecutors said he ""callously continued, at times forcing the victims to involve younger children, some aged just four"".

Alexander McCartney was 'relentless and cruel'

According to Catherine Kierans, McCartney's depravity was such that it was ""one of the most distressing and prolific cases of child sexual abuse we have ever seen in the PPS"". Ms Kierans said some of the victims have still never been identified despite exhaustive efforts by police. ""McCartney's crimes have harmed thousands of children and left them and their families dealing with the traumatic aftermath,"" she said. ""Their courage stands in stark contrast to his cowardice in targeting vulnerable young girls.""","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0e74/live/cf3350e0-92d9-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a86f/live/c6456160-92e0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6839/live/ca46f930-92f0-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5e1/live/c54ca670-9154-11ef-b9b6-5d881936e68f.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a86f/live/c6456160-92e0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/50ed/live/1948bbc0-92f3-11ef-8828-f1bee45a8090.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b2e0/live/50897740-92ef-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/940f/live/73ab03f0-937c-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.png.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/003c/live/65967da0-914f-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5fe0/live/a3dce7a0-9368-11ef-be61-9b83a7d0fbd8.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9387/live/6c21fa70-9369-11ef-82c5-1731214f9638.jpg.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crejr8grr01o

Supplied The shop has always been a family affair - as this picture from the past showing Alan (far right) and son Lee (second from left) plus other family members illustrates

Alan Hartley was never supposed to open a fruit and veg shop. A career in engineering was on the cards for the-then 19-year-old, but Alan's eyes and heart were set on running his own mobile store. He spoke to mum Janet and dad Albert and had a chat with the council about his options. In November 1960, while still a teenager, he took control of an empty unit at what would become known as the Gaunt Shopping Centre - it wasn't on wheels, but it was his. On Friday, 64 years later, Alan pulled down the shutter for the final time on local retail institution AE Hartley & Son. When we meet him, Alan, now 83, surveys the scene around the shop, including new buildings and the empty neighbouring stores in which the tills went quiet a long time ago. ""We'd be looking at a field now,"" he says, gazing across the concrete precinct. ""Not a big brick wall at the back of a chemist. The view was definitely better then.""

Simon Thake/BBC The family swapped green and white pinnies for fleeces

Three generations of the Hartley family, wearing the matching blue fleeces introduced by the business 15 years ago, are stood inside the shop. They are happily reminiscing about the memories that have been created over butter, potatoes, toothpaste and toilet cleaner during the years they have worked there. A steady stream of customers comes through the door to offer well wishes. Some leave cards. Many are emotional. ""We've had tears from several customers. I'm saving mine for a bit,"" says Janet, Alan's 89-year-old sister who has been at his side since the start. She left a job in insurance, deciding that working with family in the shop suited her better. ""We're a big family. That’s our strength. When it's backs to the wall. We present a united front,"" she adds.

Simon Thake/BBC Alan (right) opened the store aged just 19 alongside his older sister Janet (left)

For the first few years the shop, named after Alan’s father Albert Edward Hartley, simply sold fruit and veg. Fresh produce was lined up and displayed in boxes outside the front of the store on a well-swept pavement in the Gleadless area, about three miles south east of Sheffield city centre. Potatoes would arrive in huge wooden crates and have to be lugged up from the cellar. Alan’s eldest son Lee, now 51, remembers watching on a child as his father and grandfather struggled with the ""back-breaking work"" of moving huge quantities of potatoes around. ""In the early 60s people weren’t eating rice and pasta so we sold tonnes and tonnes of spuds. ""After a couple of years Dad realised the heavy lifting would kill him so he invested in a conveyer belt,"" he says. The original 1960s conveyer belt is still in operation today. Lee proudly fires it up to demonstrate its deafening whirl. The family are now looking into transferring it to a local museum.

Simon Thake/BBC The store has moved with the times - but also kept its own traditions including the locally renowned eggs

Looking out across the shop from a stool perched behind the counter, Janet reflects on the current dwindling stock, deliberately run down before closure. In the far corner is a tall glass-fronted fridge, it is half-empty and contains energy drinks. ""I remember when they wheeled that in. ""We didn't know where to put it. It seemed so big,"" she says. ""We used to sell old glass bottles of Tizer and Dandelion and Burdock. ""People used to have it with their Sunday dinner,"" she recollects with a smile. A chest freezer followed. It's currently stocked with frozen pizzas and sausages. ""People purchase food differently. They just don't shop local anymore,"" she explains.

Simon Thake/BBC The shop sits in the heart of the Gaunt Shopping Centre

Lee ended up taking over the day-to-day running in the 1990s and despite only being in charge for a mere 30 years or so, he is clear on what has kept the business alive while others around have floundered and fallen. ""Adapt or die,"" he tells me, stood near a shelf where birthday candles and soap jostle for the pre-eminent position. ""When the supermarkets became more and more popular, all the shops around us started closing; the newsagent and bakers. ""We realised that we had to diversify and start stocking those products for our customers."" Now behind the counter where there used to be a vat of loose dirty potatoes sits a neat row of greeting cards, wrapping paper and helium balloons. Time and the march of purchasing progress has not swept all before it in the shop just yet, though. Eggs can still be bought individually from a huge pile behind the counter. Customers know to return their old egg boxes to be re-used.

Simon Thake/BBC The shop has changed stock to suit customer tastes - including now selling sharon fruit to Sue

Sue Denton, 63, has been coming to the store for 40 years. She's brought flowers for the family and is buying some sharon fruit – something the shop didn't stock when it opened for the first time. ""It's near on, they sell everything. It’s like a family for me. ""I don’t know what I’m going to do now,"" she says. Mick Pearson, 68 comes in every day. Today he's buying a tin of corned beef. He jokes: ""I come in to be abused. I’m going to starve when they close.""

supplied This was the scene in the year 2000 when the store celebrated 40 years of trading

According to the youngest generation of the Hartley clan, Jamie, 19, and Amy,18, the ""legendary"" pick-n-mix sweet boxes have also stayed the same over the years since their grandfather first opened up. Amy, talking about a bag containing a mix of cheaper sweets, insists: ""It's the only place round here you can get a proper good mix up."" The teenage pair tease each other about child labour and who started working at the shop first. ""Put it this way, there’s a photo of me as a baby in the sweetie weighing scales,"" laughs Jamie.

bbc,"When the clocks go back, this landmark will still be wrong",[],,"When the clocks go back, this landmark will still be wrong

Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images The Balmoral Hotel clock is in the heart of Edinburgh

As people across the UK roll their clocks back to GMT on Sunday, there's one well-loved Scottish clock that will remain at the wrong time. Ever since the Balmoral Hotel clock tower was built in Edinburgh 122 years ago, its time has deliberately been set fast. The peculiar tradition began after intervention by railway officials at Edinburgh Waverley Station, below the clock tower. In the era before mobile phones, when watches were expensive, the clock was well-used by train passengers to watch their time. Officials thought three extra minutes would give travellers more time to collect their tickets, reach their carriages and unload their luggage before the whistle blew. It has been set three minutes fast ever since.

Brian Duncan, chief engineer of the Balmoral Hotel, said the tradition would endure. At 02:00 the clock will be stopped for an hour, and set running again the usual three minutes ahead of time. ""Passersby don't seem to notice as we've never had a complaint about the time being wrong during that hour,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""I think it's because it's happening in the middle of the night."" The Scottish Baronial-style clock tower was manually changed for daylight savings before it was automated in 2014 - just a few months after Brian took the job of looking after the clock. The change was prompted after it stopped three times over a six week period. Brian said one of the hundreds of cogs inside the original mechanism was slipping. ""I had to make a very big decision - do we continue with the clock being faulty or do we go for a small gear box controlled by a computer,"" he said.

Brian Duncan said he would always keep the clock running three minutes fast

""We now have a very small gear box compared to the original mechanism and a computer controls it."" So Brian will be sleeping in his bed when the clocks change. The hands on the four faces of the clock tower cannot be wound, so instead the clock is stopped for one hour in autumn and for 11 hours when the clocks go forward in the spring. ""It's always a Saturday night, so people on Princes Street at that time have usually had a few drinks so no-one really notices,"" he said. The only day the clock tells the true time is during the countdown to the midnight bells during Edinburgh's big Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December. The hotel pays for specialists from Smith of Derby to change the time for just one day to see in the New Year. Then it is set three minutes fast again.

Square lights inside the tower illuminate the clock face from behind so passersby can see the time more clearly at night

The 62-year-old also explained how the clock keeps its time during the year despite the forces of gravity on the minute hand. ""I was told the weight of gravity makes it faster for the first 30 seconds but then gravity makes it slower on the way back up so it equals out,"" he said. The last time the clock broke down was for more than a month in the summer of 2020 during the Covid lockdown. He now always looks up at it in the morning from his tram journey to work to make sure it is still working. The clock tower, which was designed by William Hamilton Beattie, rises 190ft (58m) into the capital's skyline. The original mechanism, although not used any more, is still in the clock tower.

bbc,Cubans endure days without power as energy crisis hits hard,[],,"Cubans endure days without power as energy crisis hits hard

BBC Yusely Perez says she was forced to collect firewood to burn for cooking

Cuba has endured one of its toughest weeks in years after a nationwide blackout which left around 10 million Cubans without power for several days. Adding to the Caribbean island’s problems, Hurricane Oscar left a trail of destruction along the north-eastern coast, leaving several dead and causing widespread damage. For some communities in Cuba the energy crisis is the new normal. As Cuba approached its fourth day without power this week, Yusely Perez turned to the only fuel source left available to her: firewood. Her neighbourhood in Havana hasn’t received its regular deliveries of liquified gas cannisters for two months. So once the island’s entire electrical grid went down, prompting a nationwide blackout, Yusely was forced to take desperate measures. “Me and my husband went all over the city, but we couldn’t find charcoal anywhere,” she explains. “We had to collect firewood wherever we found it on the street. Thankfully it was dry enough to cook with.” Yusely nodded at the yucca chips frying slowly in a pot of lukewarm oil. “We’ve gone two days without eating,” she adds.

AFP Cuba's energy infrastructure needs more investment, economists say

Speaking last Sunday, at the height of what was Cuba’s most acute energy crisis in years, the country’s energy and mines minister, Vicente de la O Levy, blamed the problems for the country’s creaking electrical infrastructure on what he called the “brutal” US economic embargo on Cuba. The embargo, he argued, made it impossible to import new parts to overhaul the grid or bring in enough fuel to run the power stations, even to access credit in the international banking system. The US State Department retorted that the problems with energy production in Cuba did not lie at Washington’s door - but argued that it was due to the Cuban government’s own mismanagement. Normal service would be resumed soon, the Cuban minister insisted. But no sooner did he utter those words than there was another total collapse of the grid, the fourth in 48 hours. At night, the full extent of the blackout became clear. Havana’s streets were plunged into near total darkness as residents sat on the doorsteps in the stifling heat, their faces lit up by their mobile phones – as long as their batteries lasted.

Residents of Havana were without electricity at night

Some, like restaurant worker Victor, were prepared to openly criticise the authorities. “The people who run this country are the ones who have all the answers,” he says. “But they’re going to have to explain themselves to the Cuban people.” Specifically, the state’s decision to invest heavily in tourism, rather than energy infrastructure, frustrated him most during the blackout. “They’ve built so many hotels in the past few years. Everyone knows that a hotel doesn’t cost a couple of bucks. It costs 300 or 400 million dollars.” “So why is our energy infrastructure collapsing?” he asks. “Either they’re not investing in it or, if they are, then it’s not been to the benefit of the people.” Aware of the growing discontentment, President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on state TV wearing the traditional olive-green fatigues of the Cuban revolution. If that message wasn’t clear enough, he directly warned people against protesting over the blackout. The authorities would not “tolerate” vandalism, he said, or any attempt to “disrupt the social order”.

AFP People were lit up by their mobile phones as they sat outside in the heat

The protests of July 2021, when hundreds were arrested amid widespread demonstrations following a series of blackouts, were fresh in the memory. On this occasion, there were only a handful of reports of isolated incidents. Yet the question of where Cuba chooses to direct its scarce resources remains a real point of contention on the island. “When we talk about energy infrastructure, that refers to both generation and distribution or transmission. In every step, a lot of investment is needed,” says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres, at the American University in Washington DC. Electricity generation in Cuba has recently fallen well below what’s required, only supplying some 60-70% of the national demand. The shortfall is a “huge and serious gap” which is now being felt across the island, says Mr Torres. By the government’s own figures, Cuba’s national electricity generation dropped by around 2.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, part of a downward trend which has seen a staggering 25% drop in production since 2019. “It’s important to understand that last week’s problem in the energy grid isn’t something that happens overnight,” says Mr Torres.

Marbeyis Aguilera says she has had no power for six days

Few know that better than Marbeyis Aguilera. The 28-year-old mother-of-three is getting used to living without electricity. For Marbeyis, even “normal service” being restored still means most of the day without power. In fact, what the residents of Havana endured for a few days is what daily life is like in her village of Aguacate in the province of Artemisa, outside Havana. “We’ve had no power for six days”, she says, brewing coffee on a makeshift charcoal stove inside her breeze-block, tin-roofed shack. “It came on for a couple of hours last night and then went out again. We have no choice but to cook like this or use firewood to provide something warm for the children,” she adds. Her two gas hobs and one electric ring sit idle on the kitchen top, the room filling with smoke. The community is in dire need of state assistance, she says, listing their most urgent priorities. “First, electricity. Secondly, we need water. Food is running out. People with dollars, sent from abroad, can buy food. But we don’t have any so we can’t buy anything.”

Marbeyis cooks for her three daughters using a basic stove

Marbeyis says some of the main problems in Aguacate – food insecurity and water distribution – have been exacerbated by the power cuts. Her husband’s manual labour also requires electricity and he’s stuck at home waiting for the instruction to come to work. The Cuban Government was due to recall state workers by Thursday – but to avoid another collapse in the grid, all non-essential work and schools have now been suspended until next week. “It’s especially hard on the children”, Marbeyis adds, her eyes tearing up, “because when they say I want this or that, we have nothing to give them.” Living without a reliable energy source is the new normal in places like Aguacate. Many have been struggling with power shortages since around the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which coincided with a sharp economic downturn on the island.

bbc,"Climate change: Big cut in UK emissions needed, says watchdog",[],,"UK needs big emissions cut, climate watchdog says

Reuters The cut needs to be made this decade, the watchdog says

The UK needs to make huge cuts to its greenhouse gas emissions this decade to help the world avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, the government's climate watchdog has said. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says the UK has the technologies to do this, but meeting the goal would require much greater investment in renewable energy, electric cars and heat pumps. While the UK has already cut its emissions by more than 50% since 1990, the CCC says it should extend this to 81% by 2035, which would make a ""credible contribution"" to the international goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. A spokesperson said the government would carefully consider the CCC’s advice.

If the government commits to the suggested target, it would represent a significant advance on the UK’s current international pledge to cut emissions by 68% by 2030. It is, however, broadly in line with the UK’s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050.

These figures do not include emissions from products manufactured abroad and imported, nor those from international flights and shipping, in line with UN standards. The UK’s relative success so far has been largely down to cleaning up electricity, with progress in other areas, such as home heating, proving more difficult. But the CCC is confident that the UK’s targets are still possible. “All the core technologies have got cheaper, and they keep getting cheaper, and that's what gives us more and more confidence that we'll be able to achieve this very ambitious level of emissions reductions,” Nigel Topping, member of the CCC, told BBC News Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt.

bbc,Man City 1-0 Southampton: Pep Guardiola says he 'will learn' from Russell Martin,[],,"Southampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected.

They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season.

Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago.

But a strange thing happened at Etihad Stadium.

Speaking to the media after Saturday's match, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team.

It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner.

Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence.

Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City’s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively.

If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in.

""I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,"" said Martin.

""There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision.

""But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager.

""To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.""

That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/f500/live/91cab290-93c7-11ef-bc46-3b8d5ca55e66.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/0d7b/live/4de51580-fea2-11ee-a9f7-4d961743aa47.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a904/live/43ffa1a0-915c-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/59e2/live/1d458950-929a-11ef-833b-7123203e35b4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/16a0/live/e4afb9c0-92cc-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/762/cpsprodpb/f500/live/91cab290-93c7-11ef-bc46-3b8d5ca55e66.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yrrrx5pr0o
bbc,England in Pakistan: Jonathan Agnew on one last collapse from the tourists in his final Test as BBC cricket correspondent,[],,"Most people expected England to lose the third Test in Pakistan before the third day was out.

But to lose by lunch was a throwback to some bad old days of England tours past. The batting crumbled to their lowest total in a Test in Pakistan, 112, and the home side had the series won soon after.

Even before Saturday, England have not been at the races in this match.

They were 100 runs short in their first innings after enjoying the advantage of winning the toss, then they drifted through the second day as Saud Shakeel was compiling a vital century.

This Test was a strange spectacle, with giant fans and patio heaters used on the surface in Rawalpindi. I don't think I've ever seen a pitch prodded and poked so much before a game.

As it turned out, the conditions were not that bad, and far from unplayable. Publicly, England made all the right noises and did not complain, though one does wonder what was said in the dressing room. It certainly appeared like there were some demons lurking at the back of the mind.

Ben Stokes' dismissal on the final day, playing no shot to a straight ball from Noman Ali, was a complete brain fade from one of the most clear-thinking cricketers I've ever seen. Stokes usually has such clarity about his game. To see such an error in judgement is really unusual.

Jamie Smith's run and swipe at Sajid Khan was horrendous, especially with Joe Root not out at the other end. It was rabbit-in-the-headlights stuff.

bbc,Why Arne Slot's Liverpool still have a lot to learn about each other - Rafa Benitez,[],,"We don't know yet how this Liverpool side will react to adversity under Slot, but I have been impressed by what I have seen so far.

Just because they have not been behind for very long in any of their games, does not mean they have not reacted and changed things during them, either.

As well as watching them against Chelsea for MOTD2 last weekend, I was at San Siro as a Uefa technical observer to see their Champions League win over AC Milan in September. Both times, they were very competitive.

They have been playing with great intensity all these years under Jurgen Klopp and it is very difficult to alter that straight away. Also, as Slot has said himself, it would be crazy to change it immediately.

So, he is keeping the good things Klopp had and, at the same time, he is giving them a little bit of defensive balance and organisation, which allows him to change their approach when he needs to.

Against Chelsea they were dropping off a little bit more, but they can still press high. Similarly, they can play penetrating passes forward, or they can use the wide areas and attack with the wingers overlapping.

Slot is giving the team more tools, to be sure they can react and adjust depending on the opponent - or so they can impose their own way to play, because if they are much better than the other team they can control possession in the opposition half, and try to find ways to create chances.

Overall, I think they have more balance and if they can continue to carry a threat in attack then we have already seen that they don't concede too many goals. Put that together, and it is the key to being successful.

They are definitely on the right path, and in a good place to go to the Emirates on Sunday. Beating Arsenal will be a good challenge and a difficult test, but I think they have the belief that they can do it, and that is the main thing.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p08gkhlm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d73f/live/f1cf1a20-9316-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7115/live/522522b0-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/62d3/live/802ce350-92eb-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ed69/live/4612c6a0-937f-11ef-b001-c5ad4742e0c1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7dc6/live/74cc85b0-931d-11ef-b22c-69d6fbdd7891.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/811d/live/4b5fee10-938b-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8e45/live/bdc5f6a0-93a1-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/899/cpsprodpb/8c17/live/17bf1480-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bfd6/live/78799110-937e-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2109/live/2d5e20b0-938d-11ef-8ba4-798734237448.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jvn83c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/2876/live/e4b0ede0-92ae-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8a73/live/841ea830-8b9e-11ef-b9c3-11131015402d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ffa2/live/0b048c90-8747-11ef-83dd-fbf1b9732cf0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a904/live/43ffa1a0-915c-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480x270/p0jxns59.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/68c5/live/8574ed30-92a0-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/88ce/live/acd5e7d0-92aa-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ff96/live/2d940320-93a0-11ef-876b-0b878ef874c5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1800/cpsprodpb/9571/live/9b4fd250-92aa-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2f46/live/0595d2d0-9301-11ef-8c67-bbcc8af12ae7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/fbf3/live/2cacbd00-92c7-11ef-9504-b516e8b5f45f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1056/cpsprodpb/7c74/live/4880c500-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/08fc/live/2dd846b0-92b1-11ef-83ce-478bdbf60eba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/db07/live/2d934010-9090-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/287e/live/c1a8a340-91d9-11ef-b3c2-754b6219680e.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/2c93/live/7991a1f0-92e8-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/59e2/live/1d458950-929a-11ef-833b-7123203e35b4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/16a0/live/e4afb9c0-92cc-11ef-8e6d-e3e64e16c628.jpg'}",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj4vd2ddwj9o

Nottingham: Hundreds dance at chip shop rave

Music fans gathered at a city centre fish bar as it transformed into a one-night rave venue. The menu at Nottingham's Lace Market Fish Bar is typically a variety of fish and chips, kebabs and burgers, but on Wednesday night it served up something different. In the first night of its kind for the chippy, it hosted local grime and garage MC Window Kid and British DJ Nathan Dawe. The floor shook as the event spilled on to the streets and staff said people could not wait for the next one.

The Window Kid from Arnold, known to friends as Greg, has been a regular customer of the Lace Market Fish Bar for years. ""It's my local chippy, and we thought it was a place where everyone's welcome,"" he said.

Firmative Media MC Window Kid and DJ and producer Nathan Dawe performed a new song

With 24 hours' notice, the micro-rave sold 35 tickets, but hundreds more attended, the MC said. ""It couldn't have gone any better. Everyone was just loving life; it was bang on,"" he added. The 30-year-old had played gigs in Nottingham since he was 18, so he was no stranger to a crowd, albeit in a slightly different setting. But for staff members Dorina Gjoshi and Sam Abbas, it was a night like no other at the fish bar.

Ms Gjoshi said she hoped the rave on Wednesday night would not be the last

""I was here serving drinks, and the floor was actually shaking,"" Ms Gjoshi said. The 35-year-old added: ""We've had quite special occasions like the playoffs and hockey finals, but not like this. ""It was a great night - something to remember.""

""Everyone was happy"", Mr Abbas said

Mr Abbas, 43, said it was an ""amazing night"". ""People are asking about [doing it] one more time. Maybe we will after New Year's,"" he added.","{'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8fd0/live/5ce1b480-92e0-11ef-9e9f-f94aa162b9ae.jpg.webp', 'https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1365/live/b34796a0-92f9-11ef-89ae-5575c76d98e6.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3653/live/8f1040a0-92ce-11ef-801b-35100c122e65.jpg.webp', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd01/live/2fdb0570-92ba-11ef-9eb1-ddc029b578ae.png.webp'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0l5w4wg9o

BBC Marti Pellow's most successful song - as part of Scots band Wet Wet Wet - is 30 years old this year

Singer Marti Pellow has admitted that after 30 years, he doesn't hate singing the song kept him at the top of the charts for 15 weeks. Love Is All Around is a member of a very small club of hits that hogged the charts in the 1990s to the point many couldn't listen to them any more. The Wet Wet Wet singer admits his relationship with the song could be complicated, but he understands what it means to people. ""Love Is All Around was a freaky wee song in the same way the Bryan Adams song was and the Whitney Houston song was,"" he told Afternoons on BBC Radio Scotland.

James Watkins/BBC Marti Pellow is celebrating 30 years of Love Is All Around with a tour next year

He said: ""It was a song that stayed around in the charts for an enormous amount of time. ""Through the passage of time, the pendulum swings with it but when I meet people they say they fell in love to that song, their son was born to that song. ""And that's great pop music. So for me - I still love it. ""I don't think I'd get out of a building or a venue without singing that song."" The songs people loved - and then loved to hate, like Adams' (Everything I Do) I Do It For You and Houston's I Will Always Love You, were attached to hit films at the time. Wet Wet Wet were approached to record a song for the Richard Curtis rom-com Four Weddings And A Funeral. They turned down covers of I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor and Can't Smile Without You by Barry Manilow, opting for the Troggs hit. Pellow, now 59, remembers the first time he heard the tune.

Getty Images Wet Wet Wet got together as teenagers and enjoyed worldwide success

""It was REM's interpretation of it that I knew,"" he said. ""Then I found out it was written by Reg Presley from the Troggs, lovely man. ""It just shows you that when a good song is written, everyone can have a shot at it."" Pellow grew up in Clydebank, near Glasgow, and became a part of Wet Wet Wet when the band were all teenagers. The band enjoyed massive success, catapulting Pellow into a heartthrob - a status that remains decades on. Between stints in and out of the band, he has continued making music, branching into West End and Broadway musicals including Chicago, Chess and The Witches of Eastwick. But it is the Wet Wet Wet hits that keep the fans coming back and he has announced a Love Is All Around celebration tour for 2025. He said he believed all the old hits would endure. ""The songs aren't about yesterday, they are about today and tomorrow."" he said. ""My idea is to celebrate the Wet Wet Wet songs - that's what people most associate me as a singer with - under the umbrella of Love Is All Around.""

Gwent Police Huw Orphan's wife Amy Burley said since the attack she ""can’t think of a day where I feel happy""

A police officer who broke his wife’s back after kicking her down stairs has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. PC Huw Orphan, 32, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court. He denied attacking Amy Burley, who also worked for Gwent Police, at their home in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2020, claiming he accidentally caught her with his leg after a row and was cleared of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Earlier this month, he was banned from joining any police force during a misconduct hearing by the Gwent force, which said he would have been dismissed immediately if he had not resigned shortly beforehand.

In an impact statement read to the court, Ms Burley said she had been left with frequent pain and mobility issues. ""I'm unable to sit or stand for a long period of time and I have a very poor and irregular sleep pattern,"" she said. ""I was unable to perform simple activities with my children, such as playing and having fun. ""After six months of sick leave, I went off on unpaid leave which has affected me and my family financially. I’m constantly drained by the whole thing.""

Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: ""This was a grave injury, as demonstrated not only by the injury itself, but by her personal statement, which shows she is still significantly affected more than four years after the incident."" The jury was told the couple met in 2017 while working for Gwent Police and got married two years later. They fought and argued often and had been arguing by text on the evening leading up to the assault.

cnn,A mom with a license plate that reads ‘PB4WEGO’ wins a battle with the state to keep it,['Alisha Ebrahimji'],2019-08-29 00:00:00,"CNN —

If you’re a parent, heading out the door before a car ride with the kids probably goes a little like this:

Parent: “Did you go to the bathroom?”

Child: “No, I don’t have to go.”

Parent: “Go now, you may not get the chance later.”

At least for one New Hampshire woman, that was pretty much the ongoing conversation she had with her four kids … so much that she made it her vanity license plate for 15 years.

Wendy Auger is proud of her “PB4WEGO” plate and told CNN she’s never had any issues with it. Until now.

New Hampshire asked Auger, in a letter she received August 16, to surrender her plate because it includes a phrase relating to “sexual or excretory acts or functions,” said Auger.

I’m not a political activist,” she said. “But this is a non-offensive thing that I’ve had and it’s part of who we are as a family and who I am and there was zero reason for them to take it away.”

The recall letter said Auger had 10 days to surrender her plate with the option to choose another vanity plate at no extra cost or have one assigned to her.

If Auger chose to get a regular plate, a portion of her vanity plate fee would be refunded to her, according to the letter.

After hearing about Auger’s situation from a mutual friend, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu got involved.

“Upon this being brought to my attention, I reached out to the Division of Motor Vehicles and strongly urged them to allow Wendy to keep the license plate she has had for the last 15 years,” Sununu told CNN in a statement.

“I recently left a message on her phone to share the good news that her plate will not be recalled.”

Auger said she was happy she got to keep a piece of who her family is with her.

“I wasn’t going to go down without a fight,” she said.

For New Hampshire residents, the cost of a vanity license plate includes the price of your town/city and state registration fees, plus $40 for the Vanity Plate fee, plus a one time $8 fee, according to the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles.

CNN reached out to the New Hampshire DMV for comment but has not heard back.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190829111230-pee-before-we-go-license-plate.jpg?q=x_164,y_38,h_803,w_1428,c_crop/h_833,w_1480', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190829111740-02-pee-before-we-go-license-plate.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190829111230-pee-before-we-go-license-plate.jpg?q=x_164,y_38,h_803,w_1428,c_crop/w_800', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150325082152-social-gfx-cnn-logo.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190219145851-queensland-emoji-license-plates.jpg?q=x_0,y_350,h_900,w_1600,c_crop/h_144,w_256'}",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/us/new-hampshire-vanity-license-plate-trnd/index.html

cnn,Fernando Arroyos: 3 alleged gang members and an associate charged in killing off-duty LAPD officer,"['Mallika Kallingal Jenn Selva', 'Mallika Kallingal', 'Jenn Selva']",2022-01-14 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: (7/19/24) Since this story was published in January 2022, Rios, Contreras, and Cisneros pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Rios and Cisneros were both sentenced to 50 years in federal prison and Contreras was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison, according to the US Attorney’s Office. Grisham pleaded guilty to violent crime in aid of racketeering and is expected to be sentenced in September.

CNN —

Federal prosecutors charged three alleged gang members and one alleged gang associate Thursday in the fatal shooting of off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer Fernando Arroyos during an attempted robbery.

Luis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio’s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged.

According to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos’ neck.

There was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.

The four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole.

CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s office in an attempt to contact legal representation for the defendants and is awaiting a response.

Arroyos, 27, “was starting a very promising career,” LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday. He was with the department for three years and assigned to the Wilshire Division.

“He found himself, after working a series of days in patrol, to have a day off, enjoying it with his girlfriend on a hunt for a house, a place to live, a place to buy and invest in this city and the future of this region,” Moore said.

Arroyos is survived by his mother and stepfather.

“He was the only child, he had a promising future, a bright future that was taken away, viciously, over a street robbery,” the chief said.

F-13 is a “large, multi-generational street gang that previously has been the subject of federal prosecutions, including two large racketeering cases,” the US Attorney’s office said in a news release.

The news release did not mention any connection between Arroyos and the suspects.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220111154021-los-angeles-off-duty-officer-shooting.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220114014029-lapd-arroyos-incident-vigil-01122022-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220114014029-lapd-arroyos-incident-vigil-01122022-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/us/gang-members-charged-arroyo-shooting/index.html
cnn,What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed,['Forrest Brown'],2024-10-14 18:40:44.804000+00:00,"CNN —

Bad weather. Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled.

It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not).

Here’s some advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled.

Before you go to the airport

Check the status of your flight before you head to the airport. If your flight has been canceled, you could save yourself the hassle of a trip to a busy airport. Pattarisara Suvichanarakul/iStockphoto/Getty Images

As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.

“Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”

Other tips from Keyes:

Sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. Also, download your carrier’s app.

Put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the flight status that way.

Check the website FlightAware for larger flight trends across the country.

Hop on waiver offers ahead of bad weather quickly. Early birds have the best choices of the remaining seats and flights.

If you’re at the airport already

Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?

Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.

Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. It might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said.

Other tactics you can try:

Go to a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines and United Airlines advise.

Use social media to your advantage, the travel advice website Travel Lens suggests. Try contacting the airline via X or other platforms when calls aren’t going through.

Try an international call center for your carrier, Keyes suggests. Calls to US domestic numbers might have longer waits.

Attitude and research matter

Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference.

“Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”

He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”

Other considerations:

Book directly with an airline if the price is the same. If you’ve booked through a third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation.

Avoid layovers when booking if possible, the consumer advocacy group US PIRG suggests. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.

Regarding tarmac delays, airlines must provide working bathrooms the entire time, US PIRG says. “After two hours, you must have food and water. After three hours, you must be in the air or back in the airport – or the airline faces massive fines.”

Help from other airlines

Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.

“When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.

“This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”

Frequent flyer miles

Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of Points Path, told CNN Travel in an email

“You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them. But you could save yourself some significant cash if you’re trying to evacuate away from a storm,” Kheel said.

“Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.

“But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”

Trapped for the night

What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?

“Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. They’re less likely to do it there’s a weather issue, he said.

Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.

Other things to consider:

Book your flight with a credit card, Smith said: “Many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.”

Consider hunkering down at the airport rather than going to and from a hotel if your flight is delayed but not canceled. A lot depends on your personal comfort level and the estimated wait time, Keyes said.

Check whether there is a hotel room available within the airport.

Try getting into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily, the Points Guy advises.

Make safety your No. 1 priority. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous, Keyes warns.

Travel insurance and receipts

Talk to an expert about whether it's a good idea to purchase travel insurance. And research what kind of coverage you might get from your credit card, too. Poike/iStockphoto/Getty Images

Consider buying travel insurance, advised Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel.

It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.”

The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211227182241-01-flight-canceled-delayed.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1245857533.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1306865126.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240424090815-pete-buttigieg-04-24.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1483116327.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1473420373.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1247904515.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1243272312.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2162032846.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html

Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

Last week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023.

Also, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021.

Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust’s chief economist, told CNN he is closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment.

“On a three-month average basis, it’s up about 200,000 people from last year,” Tilley said. “And that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.”

He added: “So when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer … that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.”

Still, other measures of layoff activity haven’t shown a worrisome spike.

US-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year’s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That’s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/77d6501e-6bfd-48f1-9210-79a06ca9ad34.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a61f55df-7353-4edf-add1-cd938a47403d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231030171043-nyse-10302023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/58730946-3a54-4c9c-979e-4ea033d7d8fe.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240508152421-biden-ebof-preview-sot-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/337f25e6-7272-4502-8814-e8d39399a6ad.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c0534e7c-1156-47b0-939e-f513f4f86ac5.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-june-07-05-24/index.html
cnn,24 of the best nude beaches around the world,['Joe Yogerst'],2018-05-24 09:20:54+00:00,"CNN —

2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.

Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It’s due to set sail in February 2025.

With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, “The Big Nude Boat” is billed as a “once in a lifetime experience” with amenities designed to “fit everyone’s style of bare cruising.”

And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area.

The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach.

“Nudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it’s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,” Tedeschi said. “It should be respected – so why not?”

Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.

From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it’s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.

“Soft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,” says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who’s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of “The World’s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.”

While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it’s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.

During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the “Adamic air bath” – his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of “the free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.”

Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.

One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a “free beach” movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.

And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:

Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay

Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay’s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.

Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand’s allure.

After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.

Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort.

Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay

Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania

The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe’s most picturesque spots to take it all off.

With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists’ colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.

Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.

Agesta Beach, Sweden

Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.

Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach’s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.

Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.

Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand

Although it’s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation’s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.

Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island’s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.

You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke’s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.

Nugal Beach, Croatia

Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Brač island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.

Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair — like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.

Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tučepi.

Moshup Beach, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts

Perched at the island’s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).

Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.

Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island’s private nude beach.

Black’s Beach, La Jolla, California

Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State’s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.

Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego.

Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)

Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it’s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.

The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.

Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany

“Grin and bare it” might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).

Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.

It’s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.

Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada

Billed as one of the world’s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.

With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.

Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.

Red Beach, Crete, Greece

This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.

Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront.

Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni’s that’s renowned for its mojitos.

Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.

Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands

Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.

Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.

Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles.

Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe.

Callantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands

Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts

While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.)

Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.

L’Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over.

Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain

Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza’s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.

However nude sunbathers aren’t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you’ll see pacing in the background aren’t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.

Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii

Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn’t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible.

Part of Makena State Park on the island’s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.

Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.

Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets.

Sometimes called the “Naked City,” Cap d’Agde Naturist Village is the world’s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.

Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want – restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).

Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.

Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy

Situated along Sardinia’s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment.

The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years.

Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future.

“We have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,” Tedeschi told CNN. “And then we thought, let’s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.”

The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby.

South Africa’s only official nude beach – and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent – is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.

Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.

Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation.

Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico

Live your “Y Tu Mamá También” fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael García Bernal were shot on location.

Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn’t legal here.)

While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy.

Metsoke Dragot, Israel

Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.

Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour’s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline.

Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.

Praia Massarandupió, Bahia, Brazil

The string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.

A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.

Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy

Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think “Swept Away ” – the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertmüller.)

Adding to the beach’s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.

Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit.

The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.

Vecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia

Edged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.

Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it’s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section.

The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that’s a big hit with local residents.

Vecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia

Haulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida

The most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.

The clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.

Given the stellar weather in south Florida, there’s usually someone in the buff on any given day.

But the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.

cnn,Kate Moss’ rain boots at Glastonbury: A fashion moment to remember,['Oscar Holland'],2019-06-26 08:51:00+00:00,"Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “Remember When?” is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.

CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

cnn,Case dismissed against teenage cousin of Uvalde school shooter for allegedly threatening school shooting,"['Ed Lavandera Joe Sutton', 'Ed Lavandera', 'Joe Sutton']",2023-08-08 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220525173629-robb-elementary-school-memorial-220525.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230808142309-nathan-james-cruz-booking.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230522160955-robb-elementary-sign-crosses.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220525173629-robb-elementary-school-memorial-220525.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/us/uvalde-shooter-cousin-arrested-threats-nathan-cruz/index.html
cnn,The planet is getting hotter fast. This is what happens to your body in extreme heat,"['Christina Maxouris Antoinette Radford', 'Christina Maxouris', 'Antoinette Radford']",2023-07-09 00:00:00,"CNN —

Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense.

Scientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis.

Climate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.

In the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels.

Here’s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.

What happens to your body

Normally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change – either lower or higher than that – it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University’s school of medicine.

“There are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,” Linden said. “The pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.”

The second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.

When you’re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn’t evaporate as easily – which pushes your body’s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.

“The higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,” Linden said.

High body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.

Types of heat-related illnesses

Mild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body’s salt and moisture and can lead to muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.

A heat rash can also develop. That’s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases.

When your body’s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what’s known as heat exhaustion.

“In this case you’re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You’re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,” Linden said.

“This is the body’s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.”

A heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.

“That’s where your body’s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,” Linden said.

Warning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC.

The hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.

“So when somebody’s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that’s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.”

Who is most at risk

Elderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.

The elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.

“Very young (people) as well, because they’re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they’re less likely to get out of the heat if they’re starting to feel overheated,” Linden said.

Student-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added.

“In this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,” Linden added.

How to stay safe

When your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.

First, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. “If somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,” Linden said. “That means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.”

Putting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.

“If you see anybody with any type of confusion, that’s an immediate red flag,” Linden added.

When it’s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities – especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.

Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink water – as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water – or more – an hour.

“If you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,” Linden said.

Try to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov. Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.

When you’re home, fans can help, but don’t rely on them as your only way of cooling down – while it may feel more comfortable, they won’t help prevent heat-related illness.

“If you’re in a super hot room, if you’ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you’ve got a fan, and you’re able to mist yourself … then fans can be helpful,” Linden said. “Fans are not foolproof.”

Finally, make sure you’re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends – especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-tesla-fire-florida.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230621101912-video-thumbnail-extreme-heat-explainer-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241009-suarez-kaye-weir.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21021132-0-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230621101912-video-thumbnail-extreme-heat-explainer-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/asheville-building-floodwater.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21029048-4883211-719-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/nasa-milton-timelapse-thumb-orig.png?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/wide-flood-thumb.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/elephants.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/milton-hunters-wide-thumb.png?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/109936-fltornadomilton-10.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-20992329-93-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21016228-520-942-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/videothumbnails/82439050-04597038-generated-thumbnail.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21031967-10129-053-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230705104755-02-weather-heat-wave-0703-beijing.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/milton-residents-tornado-01.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/09/health/what-happens-to-your-body-extreme-heat-xpn/index.html
cnn,Juneteenth flag meaning: Here’s what the symbols and colors represent,['Harmeet Kaur'],2022-06-17 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story was initially published in June 2020.

CNN —

On this holiday you might see another red, white and blue flag flying over state capitols and city buildings.

That banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States.

The flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.

The flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date “June 19, 1865” was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.

For more than two decades, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.

“This country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,” Haith said. “It (the idea for the design) just came through me.”

Designing the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here’s what each element of the flag represents.

The star

The white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.

For one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country’s last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free.

But the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states.

The burst

The bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star.

On the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land.

The arc

The curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans.

The colors

The red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.

June 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law.

And while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better – and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134331-20200618-juneteenth-flag-star.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134536-20200618-juneteenth-flag-full.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134444-20200618-juneteenth-flag-burst.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200618134509-20200618-juneteenth-flag-arc.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180615124047-harmeet-kaur.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1440,w_2558,c_fill/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200617173631-02-juneteenth-flag.jpg?q=x_0,y_130,h_1406,w_2500,c_crop/h_833,w_1480', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200617173631-02-juneteenth-flag.jpg?q=x_0,y_130,h_1406,w_2500,c_crop/w_800'}",https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec/index.html

Extreme heat is by far the most deadly kind of weather, killing on average more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to data tracked by the National Weather Service.

But as CNN as previously reported, FEMA’s hands are tied by congress and the Stafford Act — the federal law that gives FEMA the power to respond to emergencies and determines what qualifies as one.

The 77-page petition, signed by 31 labor unions, public health organizations and environmental organizations, was sent to FEMA Monday proposing an amendment to the Stafford Act that would add extreme heat and wildfire smoke to the definition of major disasters.

“This simple but elegant amendment serves to unlock critical funds for state, Tribal, and local governments and communities to manage and mitigate extreme heat and wildfire smoke—both natural catastrophes predicted to worsen in duration, frequency, and severity due to the climate emergency,” the petition says.

The petition notes that the Stafford Act can be easily amended as it was just a few years ago to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Around two dozen large wildfires are currently burning in the US, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, all of them in Western states. On the other side of the country, a dangerous, long-duration heat wave is tightening its grip on the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. About 270 million people could see temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week.

Despite the attention Tuesday’s hearing about Boeing’s safety problems will garner, it’s not clear whether it will produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm.

“Nothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,” Aboulafia said. “I’m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what’s bad.”

Calhoun announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Calhoun said he has a preferred candidate but he has not publicly identified that person and said the decision is up to the search committee and Boeing’s board.

Aboulafia said the board has shown little indication of seeing a need to change the way things are done at Boeing, calling it a “board on autopilot.” The board approved a $32.8 million pay package for Calhoun in 2023, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. And it could have been a lot more: He declined to accept his annual incentive bonus of $2.8 million – a request the board said he made after the Alaska Air incident.

At the end of the hearing Tuesday Calhoun pointed out that there have been changes among Boeing top mangers since the two fatal crashes and the grounding of the Max in 2019 and 2020, as well as additional management changes since the Alaska Air incident.

He defended using internal candidates from Boeing to fill the open positions.

“We try to select people who know a lot about airplanes,” he said.

But Senator Richard Blumenthal, the chairman of the subcommittee, argued that Boeing needed to turn to outsiders to make a true change in the culture at the company.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cd6775f7-15a7-4f25-8aa1-677c38d3bc34.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/94df600e-92ed-4aed-8565-72449ddf5147.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/fbdb3b6a-fd87-4d83-8139-2041dcecdfb9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/385a83f8-351c-4b33-b622-9da6fba242ab.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec937cd0-203d-45d6-a93f-091cbaef1020.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8c2010e9-cff9-45a2-a8a4-e40fab1f2d40.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/27e048b1-f3ce-4775-a468-1d2d6d5f3a3b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ac8633dc-e7a7-4f3a-b882-ba827a1c89d0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d9677299-1d77-4cd4-a172-5dc3c6f4303c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c8093621-9dfd-42a9-97c0-487fd1393afd.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5134816f-ddd4-4af3-9da2-a7ce683d5280.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240320155853-boeing.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7af099a0-7406-4088-a0bc-4a90c76ed106.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5d40813f-0f71-4419-b954-ac1379566a42.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5cd4d7a2-cab3-41f3-bfc6-dbe2f94562ec.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240617223707-david-calhoun-061724.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/666e5f97-a94f-4d37-9615-307fb54d72da.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1746fcd3-0a66-458e-8302-d606ed665946.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8cbea299-e0f8-4581-8b42-e9c0bc879503.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/aaae0c42-6831-4514-8812-29f8ea581ad2.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc952537-36e9-4205-a405-635fbaeb3647.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/600dd1ba-cf70-4df4-aff5-6f007fabf5dd.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/24b115df-54ea-4cc7-b367-f0ff965a551b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a5944201-c09e-4643-acf0-76b59797b292.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/65dc6f6c-cf7e-4839-9fdb-969a03ca46a6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1d8193ca-85fc-4e94-8bcf-801ae3ead763.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/boeing-ceo-testify-senate/index.html

Nathan Frandino/Reuters

Israel says it has introduced a daily “tactical pause” of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, but said there will be no let up in fighting in and around Rafah in southern Gaza.

The pauses began on Saturday and will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northward, the Israel Defense Forces said.

Soon after announcing the move, the Israeli military said “the fighting in Rafah continues,” adding “there is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.”

A bottleneck of aid has built up at Kerem Shalom amid Israeli airstrikes and fighting in much of southern Gaza.

Dire humanitarian crisis: Human rights groups have described “unspeakable” living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment. Israel’s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies.

More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a post on X on Saturday.

Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah, saying Hamas fighters are embedded in civilian areas of the enclave’s southernmost city.

The operation has led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Gazans say they have been bombed even when they evacuated to areas that were supposed to be safe — and that they have nowhere left to go. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles).

Israeli leadership criticizes the move: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard of the plan, according to an Israeli official.

Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said this was unacceptable, until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue. It raises the question of where the “tactical pause” order originated, but it’s expected to continue.

Israeli security minister Ben Gvir — a leading right-wing member of the country’s cabinet — condemned the pause. “Whoever decided on a ‘tactical pause’ for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is an evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,” he said.

Fighting and deadly strikes: Fierce fighting and airstrikes have rocked Rafah as the Israeli effort to destroy Hamas in Gaza continues. A civil defense official in the enclave told CNN heavy clashes were ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah on Sunday.

Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of Rafah Civil Defense, said the organization had received pleas to collect bodies and wounded people, but it was difficult for crews to access many areas due to Israeli military operations.

On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2f1ed58d-e754-440b-bb7e-a6fd4a8f9b2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bdf6f91f-4e72-426b-b4b2-e6da23684d97.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5adec99e-37df-4b29-8612-60dce524f518.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e1385282-e884-423b-bc49-a45f94fbd4ea.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/71b72696-effb-4d20-8774-f2629dafb998.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a868bc28-632f-4b0d-aecf-90ccf95e7fb6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/55f4c101-ea95-4b9a-a219-11de10069e81.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7f63d172-8d31-476f-8174-f7d0fe0e94fe.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9da8b69c-f941-40eb-98d2-e8bb96e7b9e5.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/7e35de78-c605-475c-b6a2-827ca2a3ed8e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d3371237-5042-4d09-a5f4-07137ef01645.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4b7b3691-34d0-42f0-807a-0071c6e61da5.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d8b18448-0a9e-4aaf-bed4-b69b004cafce.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cd6e6899-b70a-4de9-b50a-923203af7208.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240606153030-20-week-in-photos-060624.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612111752-jomana-overwrite.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e77ed5ad-7d51-4704-8e8e-96c24733a818.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-17-24/index.html
cnn,Confessions of a 1980s flight attendant,['Jacopo Prisco'],2022-06-09 10:47:46+00:00,"CNN —

“I came of age when the jet age came of age,” says Ann Hood, an American novelist and New York Times best-selling author, whose book “Fly Girl” is a memoir of her adventurous years as a TWA flight attendant, right at the end of the Golden Age of air travel.

As a child, growing up in Virginia, she witnessed the first flight of the Boeing 707 – which ushered in the era of passenger jet travel – and watched Dulles airport being built.

At the age of 11, after she moved back to her native Rhode Island with her family, she read a 1964 book titled “How to become an airline stewardess,” and her mind was made up.

“Although it was sexist as hell, it enticed me because it talked about having a job that allowed you to see the world and I thought, well, that might work.”

When she graduated from college, in 1978, Hood started sending job applications to airlines. “I think 1978 was a really interesting year, because many of the women I went to college with had one foot in old ideas and stereotypes, and the other foot in the future. It was kind of a confusing time for young women.”

“Flight attendant” was a newly minted term, a gender neutral upgrade from “hostesses” and “stewardesses,” and deregulation of the airline industry was around the corner, ready to shake things up.

But for the most part, flying was still glamorous and sophisticated and flight attendants were still “beautiful and sexy ornaments,” as Hood puts it, although they were already fighting for women’s rights and against discrimination.

The stereotype of stewardesses in miniskirts flirting with male passengers still endured, popularized by books like “Coffee, tea, or me? The uninhibited memoirs of two airline stewardesses” – published as factual in 1967, but later revealed to have been written by Donald Bain, an American Airlines PR executive.

Some of the worst requirements to be hired as a flight attendant – such as age restrictions and losing the job in case of marriage or childbirth – had already been lifted, but others remained.

The most shocking one, perhaps, was the fact that women had to maintain the weight they had at the time of hiring.

“All airlines sent a chart with your application, you looked at your height and the maximum weight and if you did not fall within that, they wouldn’t even interview you,” says Hood. “But once you got hired, at least at TWA, you couldn’t go up to that maximum weight. You had to stay at your hiring weight, which in my case was about 15 pounds less than my maximum limit.

“My roommate got fired over this. The really terrible thing about it, other than what it did to women, is that this restriction was not removed until the 1990s.”

Hood was one of 560 flight attendants, out of 14,000 applicants, hired in 1978 by TWA, then a major carrier, acquired by American Airlines in 2001.

The job started with a few days of intense training in Kansas City, where cadet flight attendants would learn everything from aircraft part names to emergency medical procedures, as well as the safety protocols of seven different aircraft. The list included the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747.

“It was kind of terrifying, because it was so big – and the stairs, the spiral stairs that led to first class that you had to go up and down not infrequently,” says Hood. “I would keep thinking: don’t trip. Eventually I got used to it.”

Carving chateaubriand

Hood's favorite plane was a Lockheed L-1-11 TriStar. Christopher Deahr/Moment Editorial/Flickr Vision/Getty Images

She says her favorite plane to work on was the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. “Domestically, only Eastern Airlines and TWA flew it. It was a very approachable, workable widebody plane with a lovely setup of two seats on each side and then four seats in the middle, so everybody could get out easily. Nobody was unhappy on that plane.”

Flying was still glamorous at the time, she says.

“People dressed up to fly and remembered the food in a good way. It’s really different from today. I can only compare it to being in a fine hotel, or maybe on a cruise ship. Nothing was plastic and coach was super nice,” says Hood, who remembers donning her Ralph Lauren-designed uniform and carving chateaubriand cooked to taste for first class passengers, who also had a choice of Russian caviar and lobster bisque to go with their Dom Perignon.

It wasn’t all a bed of roses. Smoking on board was widespread, and for flight attendants it was a nightmare.

“If you went on a five-day trip, which wasn’t uncommon, you had to pack a separate whole uniform because you just would smell so much like smoke,” Hood says. “Boy, was I glad when that stopped. The front rows of each section were deemed non-smoking, but the whole plane was filled with smoke because you couldn’t keep it from going backwards, it was ridiculous.”

What about the Mile High Club? “It wasn’t uncommon on international flights to see a man go into the bathroom and a minute later his seatmate join him, or some version of that,” says Hood. “It didn’t happen on every flight, but you saw it.

“International flights usually weren’t as full as they are now, so in those middle sections of five seats on a 747 you could see a couple put the armrests up, take a blanket and disappear under it. I can’t say what they were doing, but it looked suspicious.”

As for passengers flirting or asking flight attendants out, it was also common. “I did date passengers, but that was mostly disastrous. It was never what I had imagined. But in 1982, I met a guy on a flight from San Francisco to New York. He was sitting in 47F – and I dated him for five years.”

An empowering job

Hood has seen her fair share of bizarre things on board. “The weirdest would definitely be the woman in first class who appeared to be breastfeeding her cat. I mean, I can’t say that it was actually happening, but she had her cat to her breast.

“And then the guy who flew the whole way in his tighty-whities and his dress shirt and tie, because he didn’t want to wrinkle his pants for a job interview. Or the guy on a 747 in Frankfurt who was riding his bicycle down the aisle,” she reveals.

That said, the routine would sometimes kick in, and not every flight was a wondrous concentrate of adventure and glamor.

“I would say the job was 80% fun and 20% boring. In some flights, especially those that weren’t very full, there was a lot of time to fill. You can only serve people so much food and so many drinks, and play so many movies. I made the job fun. I loved talking to people. I loved the feel of it. I still love flying today,” says Hood.

She says it was indeed possible to actually visit and experience the cities she traveled to. “Sometimes your layover was really short or you were just tired, but for the most part, the city was right out the door. I very much took advantage of that when flying internationally.”

She left the job to focus on her writing career in 1986, and by that time things had changed. Deregulation, which removed federal control over everything from fares to routes, had come fully into effect, changing flying forever.

Planes became filled with more seats and coach stopped being as pleasant, but flying was also democratized and made available to a far larger share of society.

Hood says she is proud of her career in the skies.

“Flight attendants are a force. They’re highly unionized. They’re independent. In the cabin, they make all the decisions. They have to troubleshoot. They’re there for the emergency stuff. They land in cities where they don’t know anything or anyone and find their way.

“It’s such an empowering job, yet it’s a sexist job. In itself, it is as contradictory today as the time in which I started it,” she says.

Nevertheless, she recommends it as a career option.

But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that “no one has an idea” how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group’s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal.

Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal – an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month – did not meet the group’s demands for an end to the war.

Hamdan told CNN that Hamas needed “a clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege … and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.”

Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified recently but appeared to grind to a halt Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it.

The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.

The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.

But the pledge is expected to be an “executive agreement,” the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.

Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he’d “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if Europe didn’t increase its defense funding.

The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine’s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said. An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine’s defense.

Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights said she felt “both relief and anger about this decision.” She said she was glad the decision had been rejected, but did not believe it should have made it to the Supreme Court in the first place.

Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project warned that while today seemed like a victory for reproductive rights, “we know that this is far from the end of the line.” Dalven said other politicians were prepared to pose challenges to abortion rights in the US.

Destiny Lopez, acting Co-CEO of the Guttmacher Institute said the case was “rooted in bad faith and lacking any basis in facts or science.” Lopez said it should not have ever reached the top. court, echoing Northup’s sentiment. She also warned that further challenges to anti-abortion rights would arise despite the outcome.

President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas said the decision from the Supreme Court “provides us with long-awaited relief.” Dantas said the findings meant “patients and clinicians across the country will continue to have access to mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management.”

The President of the American Medical Association (AMA) Bobby Mukkamala released a statement applauding the Supreme Court’s decision. “Efforts to second guess the FDA’s scientific judgment and roll back access to mifepristone were based on a sham case that not only lacked standing, but relied on speculative allegations and ideological assertions,” the statement said.

Phyllis Arthur, executive vice president and head of Healthcare Policy and Programs at BIO said they were pleased that the authority would remain with the FDA to approve new medicines. “Today’s decision ensures patients and drug developers can rely on the rigorous FDA approval process as the scientific and trusted standard for drug approvals.”

Meanwhile, Danco, the manufacturer of mifepristone, said it was pleased with the outcome of today’s ruling, which “safeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use.” The manufacturer said it remained committed to providing safe access to abortion across the US.

cnn,"What a medication abortion is like, according to a doctor",['Sandee Lamotte'],2023-01-06 00:00:00,"CNN —

Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill.

“While many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.

“A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,” he said.

Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation, which is “70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,” according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.

Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the “abortion pill,” which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.

“Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic — particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion — or because they have a preference for self-care,” said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman’s health.

What happens in a medication abortion

What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?

Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.

An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there’s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.

The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.

A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.

Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.

In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.

The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.

CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?

Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.

Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.

Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.

Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That’s something people could get without a prescription.

Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we’re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we’ve been doing more research on people’s experiences with medication abortion, it’s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.

CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?

Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It’s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies — and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.

People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization.

If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill.

Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful.

People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.

CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion?

Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever — 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit — that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider.

Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well.

One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it’s wise to be on the lookout.

We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends.

Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.

If someone still feels pregnant, isn’t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician.

People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230105123125-medication-abortion-process-wellness.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220922023331-04-ohio-abortion-092222.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230105123125-medication-abortion-process-wellness.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221222133043-01-jill-hartle-abortion-rights.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221012154304-01-abortion-doctor-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/health/medication-abortion-process-wellness/index.html

Tensions at Israel’s northern border are again flaring, with Israel’s military reporting around 200 rockets being fired on Wednesday from Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said no injuries have been reported, with warning sirens sounding across towns near the border.

The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it was behind the attack, saying it was in support of Palestinian people in Gaza and in response to an Israeli attack on the village of Jouya in southern Lebanon, which reportedly killed a senior Hezbollah commander and three fighters.

The IDF said in return Israeli jets struck a rocket launcher in the Hanine area of southern Lebanon and militant infrastructure sites in the area of Yater, from which projectiles were fired at Israel on Wednesday morning.

Residents evacuate: Several houses in the village of Kadita in the Galilee region of northern Israel have been evacuated after rocket attacks from Lebanon caused fires in the area, according to Israeli police. Israeli officers have been assisting firefighters in evacuation efforts and closed a major east-west highway spanning much of northern Israel due to a nearby fire.

Attacks escalate: Israel announced last week that it was prepared for “very intense action” in the north as the exchanges of fire that have taken place almost daily since October 7 with Iran-backed Hezbollah ramp up.

The military capability of the Lebanese group is expansive, with the group boasting more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel’s defenses if an all-out war breaks out.

This post has been updated with additional figures from the Israeli military and evacuations.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240608142441-05-israeli-attack-central-gaza-060824.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9bbf2bec-bf04-4942-a777-5de5dd3b91f6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/950db37c-2303-4f90-b64e-0902abab7e27.jpeg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2968e3ef-e488-447c-bdfe-9c38bf24eeb9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/509cf76a-fccf-4340-a1fd-e53ead5c6299.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c896f4d-e05b-4d4c-89fa-52274262fc05.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e368e488-798b-4e28-a681-d50090923b6f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/76f44349-3f03-4f90-a779-d33575746038.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c45cb114-d666-44c2-bc19-0293e47b3859.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6543deff-2205-4c88-82f9-97ce80d78f8b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/27e6a76a-d4e6-45ca-b7b2-e5e7daf784d1.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612111752-jomana-overwrite.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/97e8f2fa-b54b-4b62-b5f4-3cf01a7d636e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/55dd84fc-9b26-4623-8fb5-793b1b7ab10c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f37432cf-943e-41f8-a4ae-9d214298a894.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/774f0968-d368-4c95-9d68-d7cd8871bd9c.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/426217e0-a600-450f-a45d-d7c4d29579c8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8ee22890-11ed-4a8a-9528-423239c64178.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-12-24-intl/index.html

The vote marks a major escalation in a monthslong dispute over the recordings between House Republicans and the executive branch that came after Biden asserted executive privilege over the files.

Holding the nation’s top law enforcement officer in contempt would build on Republican allegations that the Justice Department has been weaponized against conservatives, claims that have been particularly ratcheted up in the wake of former President Donald Trump’s conviction in New York for falsifying business records.

Through their subpoena fight with the Justice Department, House Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains stalled as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely.

House GOP leadership said Tuesday evening that they were confident they have the votes in their narrow majority to hold Garland in contempt, but they have been working behind the scenes to lock down their members ahead of Wednesday’s floor vote.

A handful of House Republicans have privately voiced concerns about supporting the contempt resolution, raising questions whether the conference with its narrow majority will have the votes to pass it, a source familiar told CNN. Still, House Republicans announced Tuesday evening that the vote would go forward Wednesday.

“We’re going to bring it up and pass it (on Wednesday),” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told CNN.

By a slim 208 to 207 margin, the House took a key procedural step Wednesday morning to pass the rule that will bring the contempt resolution to the floor for debate and a final passage vote later in the day.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/38c91425-fd5c-4c59-9386-7e0fdcc035d6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b155888d-916d-40c2-8998-a2ba5d0f8688.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920151831-04-garland-testifies-0920.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c45f4a64-7aaf-446d-996e-faaa5e276fd8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/737d88b0-9398-4fea-905e-fdada2da5b85.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240604115126-ls-merrick-garland-060424.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1cceeb65-1c91-49f1-ae6f-00d8519dc132.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4c69b7ec-e4ec-4d29-bdeb-310b13401c86.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/24955473-9a3a-45e6-907f-d8374ad15956.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/14187e97-dfdf-4eb9-8fc0-f443b68e1fb3.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/attorney-general-merrick-garland-contempt-06-12-24/index.html

Wall Street will be parsing the May Consumer Price Index report just hours before the Federal Reserve is slated to announce its monetary policy update.

The CPI report and Fed’s policy meeting have fallen on the same day just seven times since 2014, according to Bank of America.

Despite the rare event, it’s unlikely the stock market will swing widely because of the economic two-fer, some investors say.

“The things that could drive volatility higher would be if Chair Powell was to say something unexpected; I think that is of a very low probability,” wrote Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, in a Monday note. But if “inflation metrics come out much higher than expected, that could lead to a small sell-off. How much the market sells off would depend on how much above consensus inflation is running.”

The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold this month. Some analysts say upcoming CPI data won’t alter the Fed’s June decision, unless it shows a huge deceleration or acceleration in inflation. But the metric will still help guide the Fed’s decisions during the second half of the year.

“The number of rate cuts the Fed will actually be able to deliver this year will depend heavily on the outlook for inflation; if it remains stickier, investors may want to temper their expectations for easing for 2024,” wrote Glenmede’s investment strategy team in a Monday note.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bd3774cc-6c10-4e85-b463-987a41becb8d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/feec4cf3-a1ca-4ff6-a561-cef197801211.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b28255db-8d8b-4ff3-bf7e-6ac68bfc188f.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f9ec0d1c-5aa9-4ea6-8e30-cfd07e0c5027.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d2d27e83-3dcb-4d61-864e-9f9e4a3e0929.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1b45b7bd-f28a-4465-9838-f34847f39b91.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9f5ece4f-3144-4829-964e-41c03a28a788.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20db003b-f123-450a-966a-4c5463457ff0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e37abf17-012d-4fd9-9637-c3fd3e9eca2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/823c36e4-36ed-45d6-8717-abdff7777112.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/86d60ca1-47f6-4361-a4eb-32c8122a4415.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240508152421-biden-ebof-preview-sot-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/08a3b4af-9d27-418a-9acc-4becb48ad2dc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/867adb0c-6c66-495f-9b1a-a0f12c66d8e9.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c4151498-80dc-4eef-8dce-1bdf21de1712.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240612092401-01-nyse-0611.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec642c48-8bfc-4827-aa90-43d6b776a66a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9ac6a1df-d957-4e3c-8889-13db4cc9e762.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2d9bcc39-628d-481a-bd1b-99436a479866.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5fd093b6-ccef-4dab-a868-58f25e5b2f3d.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/783cf0df-ec90-4c68-a877-fa32f04faf24.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1584d515-0ff6-4cdb-b6ff-7e6df181cad7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a224879d-813f-4aed-b781-b1f623b70fec.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c7bad47-5a33-4992-a2be-d0cf1330b70c.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b73b2f36-a1d2-465c-a628-d76bcd70d1f8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a8597e9e-6c0c-4e31-a5bb-3532efe077c1.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/95856bca-d2e0-4d48-bf26-2473bf344096.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/markets-fed-meeting-06-12-24/index.html

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

A panel of 12 Delaware citizens is deliberating in the the federal gun trial against Hunter Biden.

This is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.

Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.

The first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.

When a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.

These questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an “unlawful user of, or addicted to” illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, “No.”

Count 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It’s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.

“Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that’s the impetus behind these laws,” Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. “The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter … but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?”

If convicted on all three counts, the president’s son could face up to 25 years in prison.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b09d1825-8996-4837-974d-fd44f2563756.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bf9f8c4e-462c-4f50-9f90-34d6fe8df0af.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f87401fc-417a-4d5a-aeef-3a9f85921262.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b3218d75-bfa9-4825-8d96-6d771e8030e2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/63c89be6-f269-4311-a42d-5d9bc0472b64.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5c574ed3-f9a3-43b1-b380-dd4a77abd455.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/fb73312c-4ab0-42b5-9b01-260c68f9dac3.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/a72deb3c-313f-4f82-be88-facb2718e0ba.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5992e016-d211-488e-82b4-45d4b7e6694a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/65ddf3b6-7550-4370-adcb-01b843c7b81f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f18e46ea-62f6-4b17-bcfa-0b88b246e0f1.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d24f8d8a-ead7-40ae-b302-d313b83cf649.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/17fda4da-1760-47a9-a9b9-a9f63e8ddf52.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/00887097-f76f-45d3-b3ba-55292357f28f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/41348e59-f89f-48b7-af15-1c601b1de6e6.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/624a59a2-1e5e-42d9-856a-01a6b3fb0982.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8e7ea755-b371-49f3-ba28-1ed29b995925.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0eb732d2-2387-40dc-a7d4-edc5450b2474.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/848ea2a6-0790-4337-b109-7b550ee49e8c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/62bf40cd-eed7-49df-b499-eca9df473945.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/dd000a85-f16a-48f0-be24-ee659059cb03.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2b47f846-56c3-497c-8e32-27e2b4d07102.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-trial-06-11-24/index.html
cnn,As Equals: Frequently Asked Questions,[],2021-04-06 00:00:00,"What is As Equals?

There is a gendered dimension to every one of our major global challenges including, but not limited to: climate change, economic or health inequality, the rise of authoritarianism, mass migration or algorithmic bias. Critical, tenacious journalism is required to expose it all.

With stories on underreported issues in underreported parts of the world, told by underrepresented voices, As Equals intends to spotlight taboo subjects, use innovative presentations and effect change.

Staffed by a dedicated team, As Equals will broaden the scope of gender reporting and build on CNN's already-established reputation for independent, world-class, mobile-first, thought-provoking journalism, with production across CNN's platforms, including newsletters and audio, documentaries, as well as events.

How is As Equals funded?

As Equals originally launched in 2018 with the assistance of a year-long Innovation in Development Reporting grant from the European Journalism Centre. The series kept going after 2019 thanks to commitment by CNN.

In October 2020, CNN announced that the series would expand with a new three-year grant of US $3.6m from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

That money -- which can only be used by CNN for As Equals -- will fund salaries and associated staffing costs; the reporting and production of journalism in multiple formats; the commissioning of freelance storytellers and the holding of events.

For the duration of the series, CNN will continue to provide As Equals with staff and logistical support.

Will the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have any influence on CNN's journalism?

No. As Equals' journalism will be completely editorially independent. All of the output from the series will be held to CNN's high standards and will be fair, accurate and responsible.

As with other grant-funded journalism, we will regularly report to the funder, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to demonstrate that CNN is spending the money in line with the purpose for which it was intended.

How long does the funding last for?

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant funds As Equals for four years, until 31 December 2024.

Why focus on gender inequality?

As Equals intends to cast a spotlight on these issues and report on them in ways that deepens global understanding and produces tangible impact.

Will As Equals include trans people in its coverage?

As Equals is unreservedly committed to inclusivity. Our stories will not only show you what gender inequality looks like, but also how inequality is not just limited to one location or people, and why it persists around the world.

How can I contact As Equals?

You can send tips or questions to the following email address: asequals@cnn.com

Please note that we're a small team and get lots of correspondence so your patience is appreciated.

How can I contribute to As Equals?

As Equals does not cover the news of the day. Rather we attempt to set the news agenda through investigative work, or deepen understanding and knowledge of causes of gender inequality and potential solutions through engaging human-interest or data stories.

If you'd like to send us tips, or make us aware of insights from research, data from studies, or the names and contacts of phenomenal people whose stories you think we should tell, you can do so by emailing asequals@cnn.com

Every year we select a couple of themes in order to give our journalists and audiences the opportunity to cover an issue or trend from multiple perspectives -- and improve the potential for impact. Get in touch to find out what series we're currently working on.

Before you pitch us a story, we'd like for you to ask yourself a few questions first:

Is my idea original? This could mean that it could be a topic, a situation or a place that hasn't already been widely reported, but it can also mean that you have access to new information or different sources; your reporting will present the story in a new way, or will help audiences see the bigger picture. Am I the right person to tell this story? Do you have access that other people don't? Do you understand a complex issue and can clearly and engagingly tell a story about it? Do you study or follow a topic closely and can see what others have missed? Am I prepared to work with others? The best journalism is collaborative. You might have a great idea but not the right contacts or data skills, for example. If we commissioned you, would you be happy to work with a team to tell your story, if it needed it? How evergreen is my idea? While we will move quicker on columns, your opinion piece or feature idea shouldn't be irrelevant at the end of the day's news cycle. Is my story right for CNN? On As Equals, we want to see the bigger picture. To uncover the systemic causes of gender inequality and tell those stories for a global audience. Will your story help us do that? Is your story going to be relatable outside of its local or national context?

Does As Equals accept video or photo pitches?

As Equals seeks to amplify underrepresented voices in front of the lens and behind the camera. We're looking for character-driven short documentaries and photo essays by and/or about women and non-binary people across the globe, and would like to hear from non-fiction filmmakers, video and photo journalists who want to tell universal stories that touch audiences emotionally and hold up a mirror to society.

If you have an idea you'd like to pitch us, consider the questions mentioned above, then submit your pitch to asequals@cnn.com

While strong preference will be given to stories in pre- or early production, you may also include links to previously-filmed material.

cnn,"June 10, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","['Lauren Said-Moorhouse Jessie Gretener Antoinette Radford Elise Hammond Aditi Sangal', 'Lauren Said-Moorhouse', 'Jessie Gretener', 'Antoinette Radford', 'Elise Hammond', 'Aditi Sangal', ""Cnn'S Mariya Knight In Atlanta"", ""Cnn'S Benjamin Brown"", 'Allegra Goodwin', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore']",2024-06-10 09:02:06+00:00,"US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said an “enduring ceasefire” deal between Israel and Hamas is “the only credible path forward” after an Israeli hostage rescue mission that Gazan officials say killed at least 274 people.

“The best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say ‘yes’ to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted, which lays out a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the return of all hostages,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

US President Joe Biden unveiled the three-phase proposal late last month, saying Israel had submitted the plan, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments since have left some doubt over his level of support for the proposal as laid out by Biden.

Civilians in harm’s way: Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel’s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm’s way.

“The president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas,” he added.

Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution “where there’s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.”

US Sen. Tom Cotton also laid blame on Hamas for keeping hostages in civilian areas Sunday. “You shouldn’t take hostages in the first place. You should release them once you have, and you certainly shouldn’t hide them in civilian areas,” Cotton told Fox News.

The Arkansas Republican said the operation, which has drawn condemnation from regional leaders, was “heroic” and “well-executed.”

cnn,Apple Intelligence: AI introduced to products at WWDC event,"['Samantha Kelly Clare Duffy Brian Fung Aditi Sangal Michael Ballaban Paul Glader', 'Samantha Kelly', 'Clare Duffy', 'Brian Fung', 'Aditi Sangal', 'Michael Ballaban', 'Paul Glader', ""Cnn'S Clare Duffy"", ""Cnn'S Samantha Kelly"", ""Cnn'S Ramishah Maruf""]",2024-06-10 15:42:12+00:00,"From Apple

Monday’s keynote saw two big AI reveals from Apple: The unveiling of Apple Intelligence — the name for Apple’s proprietary suite of AI capabilities — as well as a partnership with OpenAI that will integrate ChatGPT into many Apple devices. Where does one end, and the other begin?

The key distinction appears to fall in the line between what Apple described as “world knowledge” and “personal context.” Where Apple Intelligence will excel is combining information about you and your relationships and using those insights to streamline your everyday workflows — calling up old photos from an event or helping you create stylized AI-generated images of your contacts. Much of the processing of this data will happen within the Apple ecosystem, either on your Apple device or in special cloud-based Apple servers.

By comparison, Apple’s integration with OpenAI will let you send specific queries about the wider world to ChatGPT. Apple said that while Apple Intelligence will understand a great deal about your personal life, other AI models — such as ChatGPT — may be better suited for responding to prompts related to more general information.

Any prompts to ChatGPT will be sent to the platform on an opt-in basis — users will have to make a conscious decision to do so. You’ll also be able to use ChatGPT to create documents from within some Apple apps.

From the sound of it, the partnership will simply create an easier way for Apple users to access ChatGPT rather than providing unique or distinct AI features to Apple devices. Notably, you’ll be able to use ChatGPT through Apple without creating a ChatGPT account, and any prompts sent to ChatGPT won’t be logged and your data won’t be stored, Apple said. The company added that it’s working on integrating other AI startups’ models, too.

So the two announcements could be seen as rather complementary.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c226fb75-55f9-42d7-a756-e41e9b871780.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/923919b1-96f7-445e-9209-60f4668e66da.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c550faec-3c7a-420d-8ddb-f10f9595ded7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/05982298-e874-4706-9a42-9e5a370754be.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/99cd8087-5cd6-459f-9d6b-32e0ed14938f.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/12e9ed0b-2f3f-4541-a973-5ab457af89f3.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4763c937-d94c-4fd7-ba98-4c9ba20356b8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ea39551a-d864-4190-b6d5-235e015bf4fc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/02f24337-6ab9-43a6-b50d-912a0345aa73.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0ec07a71-417d-4ce9-a88f-944cb1a5ef2c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d96f0025-0d9b-4144-b89d-55942c6d5d55.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/00872589-ac93-4417-bbc2-4d5a2fb0b060.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/78c2ed40-5949-4365-ba20-171d26e9d774.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/152fed08-32da-4153-8284-f16fc6c63efc.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c4f6b023-ea10-41e7-9140-0bab6eb5ee0a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c7069489-6a73-4b10-9893-420bd164302e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/3bb35247-2c21-4840-9b2f-fdfc80b37230.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e84d123d-9e27-426c-9bb7-d178bd8945f7.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/99e18226-7bf6-444e-b336-7c611faad743.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/9d5d2148-b1b2-4ce8-9444-52965f613a3a.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/621c6163-a896-4b41-bda7-c71158777859.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240305171738-exp-apple-iphone-china-duffy-live-030503pseg2-cnni-business-00003501.png?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/66365245-263c-4b5f-b6c6-eb203dfc4739.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c8532e87-a8e7-464c-83e3-652385c04443.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/80395c1e-b282-4150-95bd-a410ae70d86c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/12f29b41-4ed4-4ac0-9f50-a5cc56f3e124.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5b3ca73d-1cc0-43cd-a4e8-2f583207c0ea.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/537f5ee3-d83b-4fd7-9bd0-24dc723eeacf.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240606165620-apple-nyc-live-story-card-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/apple-wwdc-keynote-06-10-24/index.html

Bill Hennessy

It was clear that speaking about her father was a very painful subject for Naomi Biden. And even though she is a graduate of Columbia Law School, she appeared very uncomfortable on the stand after the defense called her to testify Friday in the trial against Hunter Biden.

Naomi Biden entered the court on Friday with her husband, and first lady Jill Biden immediately motioned for him to come sit next to her among the Biden family and friends who make up at least the first two rows of the courtroom.

Naomi Biden’s testimony focused on two instances in 2018 when she saw her father.

The first was in August or September, when she went to visit her dad in Los Angeles. Hunter Biden had reached out to her to come visit him amid his stint in rehab. He offered to arrange the trip, and Naomi Biden said she agreed to go, even though she had not seen him in quite some time.

Naomi Biden said she met with him and his sober coach, and brought her boyfriend, who is now her husband. It was “the cleanest she had seen him since my uncle died,” Naomi Biden said.

“I was proud of him, and I was proud to introduce Peter to him,” she said.

On the stand, Naomi Biden came across as genuine and compelling as the child of an addict.

She then testified about a trip to New York City, where Hunter Biden came to pick up a car. She described seeing him at the end of October, and said she felt “hopeful.” Naomi Biden said her father seemed the same as when she had seen him in Los Angeles.

On cross-examination by prosecutor Leo Wise, she again testified about how she had not seen her father recently because “after my uncle died, things got bad,” around 2015.

Prosecutors got her to concede that she really did not know what he was like when he was using drugs, because she had not seen him for quite some time.

Prosecutors seemed to catch Naomi and defense attorney Abbe Lowell off guard when they introduced her to a series of texts she exchanged with her father during the trip to New York.

Naomi Biden seemed a little confused and reticent when confronted with texts appearing to show her father to be somewhat erratic and non-communicative when trying to arrange the hand off of his car.

She did not remember the exchange and started to appear increasingly uncomfortable when talking about texts her father sent her in the wee hours of the morning about exchanging his car.

As she left the stand, Naomi Biden gave her dad a cool embrace, a kiss on the cheek, and was seen trembling and wiping away tears as she exited the courtroom.","{'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6f755857-67f0-4772-a6b0-0a432e6f5afb.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5c05062e-ca4e-4662-b11e-f7d77ef38b4c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610201301-hunter-biden-women.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ec35b129-a6b1-411d-844b-89d3e1c883f2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0c443859-e6d3-47aa-ae5c-2f86c8bd3d20.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240610091648-01-hunter-biden-061024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-10-26t033503z-1247087777-rc23saamjf9d-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-explosions.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b3302384-5771-403f-8d7e-a021290aaba2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20eb055c-b8e5-41f8-a2d1-0e8bd38f13c0.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/58ca0933-7be6-4f3c-90c0-45fed4a6647e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2b6d8fec-36e6-4dbe-83ff-70312867fd2e.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f2e90b17-24f6-4003-b3f7-9f5931811b94.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ddec0ec0-fb4b-4759-9a2c-551ebf146b3f.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e155d849-10fc-4adf-8518-a930f3d5b0d2.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20241023-trumpharris-superalt1x1.jpg?c=1x1&q=h_256,w_256,c_fill'}",https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-trial-06-10-24/index.html

“The best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say ‘yes’ to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted, which lays out a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the return of all hostages,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

US President Joe Biden unveiled the three-phase proposal late last month, saying Israel had submitted the plan, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments since have left some doubt over his level of support for the proposal as laid out by Biden.

Civilians in harm’s way: Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel’s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm’s way.

“The president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas,” he added.

Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution “where there’s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.”

US Sen. Tom Cotton also laid blame on Hamas for keeping hostages in civilian areas Sunday. “You shouldn’t take hostages in the first place. You should release them once you have, and you certainly shouldn’t hide them in civilian areas,” Cotton told Fox News.

The Arkansas Republican said the operation, which has drawn condemnation from regional leaders, was “heroic” and “well-executed.”

Europe’s drift to the right has been a long journey that’s seen the continent’s mainstream increasingly accommodate people with Euroskeptic views that were once fringe.

The projected gains for the hard right in the European parliamentary elections may seem modest in terms of pure numbers, but they are significant.

The results represent a major challenge to the pro-Europe mainstream officials who dominate the institutions of the European Union.

The advances chalked up by far-right parties may not be unexpected, and they don’t pose an existential crisis for the EU. But they show how the Euroskeptic right could, in the coming years, tighten its grip on the direction of the union.

Over the next 24 hours, the parties of the center – projected to remain the largest bloc in the European Parliament – will likely talk of a “grand coalition” to counter the rise of the far right. And while the far right is on course to make large gains, the center parties remain ahead.

On paper, these pro-EU parties can claim victory. On numbers alone, the centrist coalition has held. The center-right European People’s Party, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, and the liberal Renew Europe are the three largest groups in the European Parliament. When you throw the pro-Europe Greens into that, the center is by far the largest block.

Trump took time off the campaign trail for a closed-door meeting at Mar-a-Lago with officials representing the vaping industry.

The vaping emissaries talked about loosening regulations and told the former president he had “saved” the industry in the past. The group — including Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and another 2016 campaign aide, Michael Rubino — showed him mock-ups of mailers they were sending out through Election Day. Mr. Trump asked for input on what he could say on social media about a complicated regulatory issue.

Within hours, Mr. Trump had posted about his allegiances to the embattled e-cigarette sector. “I saved Flavored Vaping in 2019,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. “I’ll save Vaping again!”

The head of the Vapor Technology Association, Tony Abboud, who was also in the meeting, quickly declared he was “pleased” that Mr. Trump was “continuing to fight for vapers.” The vaping industry has not been a significant contributor in the presidential race, but the Vapor Technology Association has been quietly sending versions of those mailers to voters in battleground states warning that Democrats want “to steal vapes from freedom-loving Americans.”","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/us/politics/26pol-trump-promises2/26pol-trump-promises2-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/22/reader-center/author-jonathan-swan/author-jonathan-swan-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/multimedia/author-shane-goldmacher/author-shane-goldmacher-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/us/politics/26pol-trump-promises2/26pol-trump-promises2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-industry-promises.html

Trump decided to take a day off the battleground campaign trail in the waning days of the race to hold a rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden, it prompted a question from many political observers: Why?

New York is hardly a battleground state, and New York City is still a Democratic stronghold. So how come Mr. Trump is planning an event in Midtown Manhattan in the final two weeks of his presidential campaign?

Here are five reasons:

He will get to see his name in lights.

Mr. Trump was a performer and reality TV star before he was a political candidate and president. (It is worth recalling that at the Republican National Convention this summer in Milwaukee, Mr. Trump appeared onstage with a Broadway-style light display spelling out T-R-U-M-P.)

For years, Mr. Trump has measured the significance of his rally venues in part by who had appeared there before.

nytimes,What to Know About the Chinese Hackers Who Targeted the 2024 Campaigns,['Devlin Barrett'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"A sophisticated breach of American telecommunications systems has extended to the presidential campaigns, raising questions about the group behind the attack and the extent of its efforts at collecting intelligence.

It was unclear what data was taken in the attack. The far-reaching operation has been linked to the Chinese government and attributed to a group experts call Salt Typhoon. Investigators believe hackers took aim at a host of well-connected Americans, including the presidential candidates — reflecting the scope and potential severity of the hack.

Here’s what to know.

What is Salt Typhoon?

Salt Typhoon is the name Microsoft cybersecurity experts have given to a Chinese group suspected of using sophisticated techniques to hack into major systems — most recently, American telecommunication companies. The moniker is based on Microsoft’s practice of naming hacking groups after types of weather — “typhoon” for hackers based in China, “sandstorm” for efforts by Iran and “blizzard” for operations mounted by Russia. A second term, in this case “salt,” is used to denote the type of hacking. Experts say Salt Typhoon seems to be focused primarily on counterintelligence targets, unlike other hacking groups that may try to steal corporate data, money or other secrets.

What do U.S. officials think Salt Typhoon has done?

National security officials have gathered evidence indicating the hackers were able to infiltrate major telecom companies, including but not limited to Verizon.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dc-china-hack/26dc-china-hack-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dc-china-hack/26dc-china-hack-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/salt-typhoon-hack-what-we-know.html

A California native and resident of Los Angeles, Ms. Harris was not only a unifying and inspiring generational figure, in the board members’ view, but also an important bulwark between Donald J. Trump and democratic institutions. They were unaware, however, that a different and more powerful group had been meeting — the family of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s owner — with far different plans for the newspaper’s voice.

This week, the biotech billionaire who had bought the paper in 2018 for $500 million acted on those plans with scant internal or public explanation, abruptly vetoing the planned endorsement, informing the board through an intermediary that The Los Angeles Times would make no recommendation in the presidential race.

For days, readers in overwhelmingly liberal Southern California speculated angrily about a decision that was widely regarded as a favor to Mr. Trump and a vote of no confidence in Ms. Harris.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/05/reader-center/author-shawn-hubler/author-shawn-hubler-thumbLarge-v3.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26nat-lat-01-ljfb/26nat-lat-01-ljfb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/reader-center/author-soumya-karlamangla/author-soumya-karlamangla-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26nat-lat-01-ljfb/26nat-lat-01-ljfb-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/los-angeles-times-endorsement-soon-shiong.html

If it retaliates, it risks further escalation at a time when its economy is struggling, its allies are faltering, its military vulnerability is clear and its leadership succession is in play.

If it does not, it risks looking weak to those same allies, as well as to more aggressive and powerful voices at home.

Iran is already in the middle of a regional war. Since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has moved swiftly to damage the militant group in Gaza and other Iranian proxies, including Hezbollah, the Houthis and its allies in Syria and Iraq.

These groups represent Iran’s “forward defense” against Israel, the heart of the nation’s deterrence. They have been badly weakened by the Israeli military’s tough response since Oct. 7, which weakens Iran, too, and makes it more vulnerable.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/multimedia/author-steven-erlanger/author-steven-erlanger-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26iran-top-mfgh/26iran-top-mfgh-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26iran-top-mfgh/26iran-top-mfgh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/world/middleeast/iran-israel-retaliation.html

As an early advocate of the $15 minimum wage and criminal-justice reform, he was seen as a rising national figure and progressive champion with blue-collar street cred. But over the past two years, he has irritated both wings of his party. He was one of President Biden’s staunchest defenders, arguing for him to stay in the race when Democratic leaders were working to get him out. At the same time, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip, which has pitted him against many progressives, some of whom now feel betrayed by him.

We talked about all of this and also the dynamics of the presidential election in his crucial state, where he says Trump is stronger than ever.

But a quote from Ari, the Hollywood macher, to Puck’s Matthew Belloni about the gender chasm in 2024 caught my eye.

“This election is gonna come down to probably 120,000 votes,” Ari said. “You probably have 60 percent of the male vote for Trump, and the female vote is 60-40 for Kamala. It’s a jump ball. We’re gonna find out who wants this more — men or women.”

Are we back to the days of Mars versus Venus? Or did we never leave?

It is the ultimate battle of the sexes in the most visceral of elections. Who will prevail? The women, especially young women, who are appalled at the cartoonish macho posturing and benighted stances of Donald Trump and his entourage? Or the men, including many young men, union men, Latino and Black men, who are drawn to Trump’s swaggering, bullying and insulting, seeing him as the reeling-backward antidote to shrinking male primacy.

Drilling into the primal yearnings of men and women — their priorities, identities, anger and frustration — makes this election even more fraught. When I wrote a book about gender in 2005, I assumed that, a couple of decades later, we’d all be living peacefully on the same planet. But no Cassandra, I. The sexual revolution intensified our muddle, leaving women in a tangle of dependence and independence in the 21st century. The more we imitated men, the more we realized how different we were.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dowd-fmwj/26dowd-fmwj-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26dowd-fmwj/26dowd-fmwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/donald-trump-gender-election.html
nytimes,The New York Times Editorial Board Endorses Kamala Harris for President - The New York Times,['The Editorial Board'],2024-09-30 00:00:00,"It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest. He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities — wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline — that he most lacks.

Those disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates.

This unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.

For this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/06/multimedia/30edboard1-pqmw/30edboard1-pqmw-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/06/multimedia/30edboard1-pqmw/30edboard1-pqmw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-2024-endorsement.html
nytimes,Opinion | The Risk of Trump’s Old Age,['Nicholas Kristof'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"What should we think as Donald Trump urges people to vote in January, confuses places and names, fumbles for words, simplifies his speech patterns, describes recent experiences that did not happen and in public seems increasingly vulgar, menacing and unfiltered?

When President Biden showed his age and stumbled through the June presidential debate, I was among the first commentators to call on him to withdraw from the race. So what about the 78-year-old Republican nominee? Frankly, I wavered about writing this column, for there is an unfortunate history, notably during Barry Goldwater’s run for president in 1964, of using quasi-medical language to undermine candidates one disapproves of. That is grounds for great caution. But if we’re trying to gauge a nominee’s fitness for office over the next four years, we also should acknowledge questions of Trump’s aging and capacity to do the job, as we did with Biden.

It’s unarguable that Trump is acting even more erratically than he has in the past. It’s also indisputable that Trump is at an age when many people see a physical or mental decline over the following four years. Perhaps one lesson from the Biden agonistes of this summer is that just as companies move C.E.O.s out before they struggle, we should be wary of electing elderly presidents from either party.

Let’s acknowledge the risks of armchair analysis at a distance and note that Trump still has physical vigor and a defense against suggestions of cognitive decline: For decades, he has behaved outrageously and sometimes been rewarded for it. And some people do not think Trump’s behavior is related to aging. Mark Esper, an honorable man who was Trump’s defense secretary and has criticized him as a “threat to democracy,” told me that Trump looks older to him but not obviously changed beyond that.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/multimedia/26kristof-cmjw/26kristof-cmjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/multimedia/26kristof-cmjw/26kristof-cmjw-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/trump-age-decline-behavior.html
nytimes,Opinion | Democrats Finally Did What Sherrod Brown Asked For. It Might Be Too Late.,['Alec Macgillis'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"Twelve years ago, Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat, took the stage at his election night party in Columbus to celebrate winning a second term. Barack Obama had just carried Ohio for the second time, after emphasizing his administration’s rescue of the auto industry. Mr. Brown wanted to proclaim that success onstage, but he was losing his voice, so his wife, the writer Connie Schultz, took over for him.

As she got to Jeep expanding its Toledo operations and General Motors building the Chevy Cruze at its rejuvenated plant near Youngstown, Mr. Brown started interjecting croaks to make sure she got the details right. “The aluminum is made in Cleveland … the transmission is made in Toledo … the engine is made in Defiance … the airbag is made in Brunswick.”

I thought about that moment often while on the campaign trail in Ohio this month. Mr. Brown is running for re-election again. But the political landscape is much changed. Ohio is no longer a presidential battleground. G.M. no longer makes the Cruze — the Lordstown plant where it was assembled closed in 2019. And Mr. Brown, who won his last two races by five and seven points, is in a tight race against a car dealership magnate named Bernie Moreno.

Mr. Brown and a dwindling band of Democrats in Ohio are still making the case for a certain kind of Democratic Party — one that cares about the working class, that invests in their towns and factories and values the manufacturing jobs that power the nation. That case should have become easier to make of late. Over the past four years, the Biden administration has championed huge investments in renewable energy and computer chip production; two new Intel plants are under construction near Columbus. Yet the political landscape is tougher than ever for Mr. Brown and the last remaining Ohio Democrats.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26macgillis-hwgj/26macgillis-hwgj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26macgillis-hwgj/26macgillis-hwgj-facebookJumbo.jpg'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/opinion/sherrod-brown-ohio-election.html
nytimes,Israel’s Response to Iran,['Melissa Kirsch'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"First, we want to update you on the latest from the Middle East. The Israeli military struck Iran overnight, in response to the barrage of missiles that Iran had fired at Israel this month.

Israel’s attack seemed limited, and Iranian officials appeared to downplay the impact. The combination made it unclear whether the fighting between the two countries would expand — or whether Iran would choose not to respond. The White House expressed support for Israel, describing the attack as proportionate, and said it should be the end of military exchanges.

Israel said it had targeted air defense systems and long-range missile production sites in Iran, as well as sites in Syria and Iraq. Two Iranian soldiers were killed, according to Iran’s military. By midmorning, life in Tehran looked normal, people in the city said. Children were in school, and adults had gone to work.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26themorning-iran-plkv/26themorning-iran-plkv-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26themorning-iran-plkv/26themorning-iran-plkv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/briefing/israel-iran-strikes.html

The woman, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant for the defendant, has been in Manhattan criminal court every day as scores of prospective jurors arrive for selection in a case that has divided New Yorkers from the moment the video of Mr. Penny holding the homeless man, Jordan Neely, on the subway floor ricocheted around the internet in May 2023.

However, Mr. Penny, who faces charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, is far from her most high-profile client.

Ms. Dimitrius, whose clients have spanned the spectrum from celebrities to corporations to the president of Brazil, worked with lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse, who in 2021 was acquitted of killing two people and wounding another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Wisconsin. In 1994, O.J. Simpson’s team hired her to help select a favorable jury. Before that, she worked with defense lawyers in three cases that arose from the beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991, an episode that set off rioting.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/00penny-jury-wjbv/00penny-jury-wjbv-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/00penny-jury-wjbv/00penny-jury-wjbv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/daniel-penny-jury-consultant-ny-subway-choking.html
nytimes,Florida Farmworker Who Suffered Heat Strokes Is Stunned at Ban on Outdoor Protections,['Patricia Mazzei'],2024-10-26 00:00:00,"The heat stroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.

He is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.

Mid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.

Mr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/us/00nat-fla-heat-worker/00nat-fla-heat-worker-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/us/00nat-fla-heat-worker/00nat-fla-heat-worker-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-patricia-mazzei/author-patricia-mazzei-thumbLarge.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/florida-farmworkers-heat.html
nytimes,Phil Lesh Didn’t Hold Songs Down. He Lifted Them Higher.,['Jon Pareles'],2024-10-25 00:00:00,"Some rock bassists make it their job to hold down the bottom of a song: to hone parts that crisply but unobtrusively stake out a harmonic and rhythmic foundation, that are felt as much as heard. Phil Lesh, a founding member of the Grateful Dead who died on Friday at 84, wasn’t one of them. Instead, Lesh’s playing carried songs aloft.

In the telepathic tangle of the Grateful Dead’s arrangements — never played the same way twice — Lesh’s bass lines hopped and bubbled and constantly conversed with the guitars of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir. His tone was rounded and unassertive while he eased his way into the counterpoint, almost as if he were thinking aloud. Lesh’s playing was essential to the Dead’s particular gravity-defying lilt, sharing a collective mode of rock momentum that was teasing and probing, never bluntly coercive.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/25LESH-APPRAISAL-02-cbpw-print1/25LESH-APPRAISAL-02-cbpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25lesh-appraisal-06-vbkh/25lesh-appraisal-06-vbkh-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25LESH-APPRAISAL-01-cbpw/25LESH-APPRAISAL-01-cbpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-jon-pareles/author-jon-pareles-thumbLarge.png'}",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/arts/music/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-bassist.html

Territory has changed hands, a prominent commander has switched sides and retreating fighters have sexually assaulted, kidnapped and killed villagers as they have moved through contested countryside, according to activists, democracy groups and accounts on social media.

A military cargo plane slammed into the desert in the western region of Darfur, with at least two Russian crew members on board, offering direct evidence of the growing role of foreign contractors in the fighting.

And Sudan’s military, after losing control of vast areas of Sudan, has finally seemed to regain the advantage over the Rapid Support Forces, the powerful paramilitary group that it has been battling for the past 18 months.
