      "Israel’s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel’s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empty threats?\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran’s official media in the hours before and after Israel’s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel’s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America’s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. \"I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,” he said. \"I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond.\" Iran’s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey’s NTV network that \"any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.” Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: \"Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force.\" It was, he said, \"highly misleading and baseless\" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran’s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence \"as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter\". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deadly exchanges\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called \"axis of resistance\" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel’s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran’s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran’s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden’s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden’s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel’s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to \"take the win\" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden’s plan seemed to be working.\n",

      "Reuters About 1,200 people were killed in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran’s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah’s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel’s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza’s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It’s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel’s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.\n",

      "Israeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran \"recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,\" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was \"limited damage\" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness \"to defend the state of Israel\". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be \"obliged to respond\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was \"targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm\" and suggested that was \"precisely what transpired\" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets \"in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against \"Iranian aggression\" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to \"de-escalate the situation across the region\". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed \"deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation\", while Jordan described the attack as a \"dangerous escalation\". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said \"what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation\". Iran's missile attack on Israel The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. \"It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,\" the agency quoted him as saying. \"Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it.\" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.\n",

      "Commonwealth leaders have agreed the \"time has come\" for a conversation about reparations for the slave trade, despite the UK's desire to keep the subject off the agenda at a two-day summit in Samoa. A document signed by 56 heads of government, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, acknowledges calls for \"discussions on reparatory justice\" for the \"abhorrent\" transatlantic slave trade. The statement says it is time for a \"meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation\". Sir Keir said there had been no discussions about money at the meeting, and that the UK is \"very clear\" in its position that it would not pay reparations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK has faced growing calls from Commonwealth leaders to apologise and pay reparations for the country’s historical role in the slave trade. Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as a result of slavery could take many forms, from financial to symbolic. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street had insisted the issue would not be on the agenda. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Sir Keir said Commonwealth leaders had a \"positive two days\" in Samoa and downplayed the prominence of reparations at the summit. \"The dominant theme of the two days has been resilience and climate,\" he said, adding that the section of the joint statement discussing reparations amounts to \"one paragraph in 20-something paragraphs\". \"None of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,\" he said. Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK would not pay reparations for slavery.\n",

      "Employers' National Insurance hike to raise £20bn\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancellor is set to increase the National Insurance rate for employers to boost funding for public services including the NHS. Rachel Reeves is also expected to use Wednesday's Budget to lower the threshold for when employers start paying the tax - with the two measures combined to raise about £20bn. The move is thought to be the single largest revenue raiser of next week's Budget, with other tax rises expected, although Reeves is not likely to introduce the levy to employers' pensions contributions. Employers currently pay National Insurance of 13.8% on a worker's earnings above £175 a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "A government source said: \"There is a universal consensus that the NHS needs more money. \"That means asking businesses to help out. The choice is investment versus decline.\" At a news conference at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn on the detail of Wednesday's Budget. But he said the government would take \"tough decisions\" with the aim of putting the NHS \"back on its feet\". National Insurance contributions are the UK's second-largest revenue stream behind income tax. It is paid by workers and the self-employed on earnings and profits, and by employers on top of the wages they pay out. Speculation has been growing about the tax rises Labour will announce in its first Budget in almost 15 years, with the chancellor claiming there is a £22bn \"hole\" in the public finances. Other than National Insurance for employers, the freezing of income tax thresholds could be extended, meaning more people are \"dragged\" into paying tax, or higher rates of tax, as their wages rise and cross the unchanging thresholds. The government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, and changes to inheritance tax. Last week, Reeves signalled businesses would face an increase in National Insurance, when she said Labour's election pledge not to increase contributions on \"working people\" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. The chancellor is understood to have decided on all major measures to be announced in Wednesday's Budget and that the National Insurance rise has been earmarked for the NHS. Any changes to the tax can be introduced quickly, within weeks of a Budget, through digitalised payroll systems, meaning revenues can also be generated at speed. A two percentage point rise in National Insurance to take the employer rate to 15.8%, for example, would raise about £18bn a year according to published Treasury data. However, with Reeves also expected to change the threshold businesses start paying the levy, such a figure would probably be higher. The chancellor may face claims she is levying a tax on jobs, and breaking at least the spirit of the Labour manifesto. Sources however say she has resisted internal pressure to simply increase the amount employees pay in National Insurance, which was the party's specific election promise.\n",

      "Georgia's ruling party is leading a pivotal election focused on the country's future path in Europe, according to preliminary results. The Georgian Dream party of billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili is on 53%, based on a count of more than 70% of the vote, the central election commission says. The increasingly authoritarian party and four pro-EU opposition groups trying to end its 12 years in power had earlier both claimed victory based on competing exit polls. Georgians turned out in big numbers on Saturday in this South Caucasus state bordering Russia, and there were numerous reports of vote violations and violence outside polling stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One opposition official in a town south of the capital Tbilisi told the BBC that he was beaten up first by a local Georgian Dream councillor, and then \"another 10 men came and I didn’t know what was happening to me\".

But a poll for the big, government-supporting Imedi TV channel gave Georgian Dream 56%. Some time later, the central election commission (CEC) came out with the first projections. The CEC has come under criticism for being too close to the government and for rushing through electoral reform ahead of the election without sufficient consultation.\n",

Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, told supporters it was a \"rare occasion in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation\". However, opposition leaders had a very different take. Tina Bokuchava of the biggest opposition party, the United National Movement said: \"We believe the Georgian public have voted clearly for a future at the heart of Europe and no amount of posturing will change that.\" \"This is the moment. In future there may be no such moment,\" opposition voter Levan Benidze, 36, told the BBC. \"I know there are a lot of geopolitical risks - from Russia - but this could be the pivotal moment, a turning point.\"\n",

It will have appreciated Georgian Dream’s campaign promise of a “pragmatic” Russia policy, not to mention Brussels’ decision earlier this year to halt Georgia’s EU accession process. Georgian Dream has promised voters they are still on course to join the EU, but it has also accused the opposition of helping the West to open a new front in Russia's war in Ukraine. Georgia's Russian neighbour still occupies 20% of its territory after a five-day war in 2008.\n",

He has repeatedly spoken of a \"global war party\" pushing the opposition towards joining the war in Ukraine, with Georgian Dream (GD) cast as the party of peace. For many voters the message has worked. \"The most important thing - for me, my family, my grandchildren - is peace that I wish for all Georgians,\" GD voter Tinatin Gvelesiani, 55, told the BBC at a polling station in Kojori, south-west of the capital. \"Only Georgian Dream\" would bring peace, she added.\n",

      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‘s three-hour interview with America’s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released. In the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the “biggest mistake” of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea’s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists. Two years ago Rogan described Trump as “an existential threat to democracy” and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk. The Republican’s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump on his 'biggest mistake'\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump told Rogan the “biggest mistake” of his 2017-21 presidency was “I picked a few people I shouldn’t have picked”. “Neocons or bad people or disloyal people,” he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy. “A guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,” Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had “fascist” tendencies. Trump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as “an idiot”, but useful at times. “He was good in a certain way,” said Trump. “He’s a nutjob. \"And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’ He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump says he told Kim Jong-un 'go to the beach'\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump said he got to know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “very well” despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.” “By the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,” Trump said. Trump said he urged Kim to stop building up his “substantial” weapons stockpile. “I said: ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy? Go to the beach, relax. “I said: ‘You’re always building nuclear, you don’t have to do it. Relax!’ I said: ‘Let’s build some condos on your shore.’” Trump also argued that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had been president. “I said, ‘Vladimir, you're not going in,’” he told Rogan, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I used to talk to him all the time. “I can't tell you what I told him, because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.” Trump said Putin invaded Ukraine because “number one, he doesn’t respect Biden at all”. The White House has previously accused Trump of cozying up to foreign autocrats.\n",

      "Asked for proof to back up his false claims that the 2020 presidential was stolen from him by mass voter fraud, Trump told Rogan: “We’ll do it another time. “I would bring in papers that you would not believe, so many different papers. That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked.” Rogan pressed him for evidence. Trump alleged irregularities with the ballots in Wisconsin and that Democrats “used Covid to cheat”. “Are you going to present this [proof] ever?” asked Rogan. “Uh…,” said Trump before pivoting to talk about how 51 former intelligence agents aligned with Joe Biden had falsely suggested that stories about his son Hunter Biden’s laptop were Russian disinformation. “I lost by, like, I didn’t lose,” said Trump, quickly correcting himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris 'very low IQ'\n",

      "Trump lashed out at his political opponents and praised his allies, many of whom are likely to appeal to Rogan’s fanbase. He called his rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, a “very low IQ person” and described California's Gavin Newsom as “one of the worst governors in the world”. Trump said that Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan’s podcast in the past, was “the greatest guy”. He also said he is \"completely\" committed to bringing Robert F Kennedy Jr into a potential new Trump administration. The former independent presidential candidate, who has a close friendship with Rogan, dropped out in August and endorsed the Republican nominee. Trump said he disagrees with Kennedy on environmental policy so would instead ask the vaccine critic to \"focus on health, do whatever you want\".\n",

BBC News spoke to the mother of Pte Gregg Stone, who was shot dead on a rescue mission in Helmand Province in June 2012. Weep for yourself, my man You'll never be what is in your heart Weep, little lion man You're not as brave as you were at the start. \"I had to fight back tears when I heard that song on the car radio yesterday,\" says Angie Moore. Her son Gregg Stone, 20, idolised Mumford & Sons, she explains. And the 2009 song, Little Lion Man, was a favourite. Gregg's big sister, Jennie, had booked tickets to see them in concert when he came home on leave from Helmand Province. Neither sibling would see the band. Gregg would also never hold his daughter. On 3 June 2012, Gregg, of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot and killed attempting to free an Afghan policeman who had been kidnapped by Taliban fighters. At the time of his death, his wife and childhood sweetheart, Samantha, was expecting their first child.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Public transport is a nightmare,\" says 19-year-old Jack Pears - which is why he relies on a car. He says he needs it to pick up his younger sister from school in Swansea while his parents are at work. But he wouldn't have initially been able to do that if the AA got its way with a raft of new restrictions on young drivers like him. One of the proposals unveiled by the motoring body this week was to ban new drivers under 21 from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months after they pass their test. It comes after an inquest found the deaths of four teenage boys could have been avoided when their car careered off a road during a camping trip in Wales last year. While the government isn't thought to be considering the idea, it has got plenty of young people talking - many of whom say the proposals are unfair. Faye Cullum has been taking driving lessons designed for people aged under 17 and is excited by the prospect of using a car. \"If this rule came into place, it wouldn't give me any motivation to drive at all,\" says the 16-year-old from Norfolk. \"I want to drive because it gives me a lot more freedom.\" She adds: \"If I'm paying for my car, the insurance and the tax - why should they be able to control who is allowed in it?\" Some are questioning why elderly drivers shouldn't face tougher rules too.\n",

      "Older driver crashes on the rise\n",
      "\n",
      "Department for Transport figures show that 4,959 people were killed or seriously injured in crashes last year involving drivers aged under 25 – a decrease of 60% since 2004. Meanwhile last year there were 3,451 such casualties in crashes involving drivers aged 70 or over – an increase of 12% over the same period. The intergenerational issue was brought to the fore on Tuesday when an inquiry ruled that 91-year-old Edith Duncan, who had dementia, was not fit to drive when she fatally hit three-year-old Xander Irvine in June 2020. The fatal accident inquiry called for drivers aged over 80 to take a cognitive test before their licence is renewed. Under current rules, those above 70 can renew their licence every three years though must declare any cognitive problems. If they don't they could be fined £1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "We put that point to the AA's president Edmund King - why call for more restrictions for younger motorists, but not elderly drivers too? He says the AA has already discussed some safety measures aimed at older drivers such as mandatory eye tests when they turn 70 and giving GPs more powers to flag risks to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). But, warning of social isolation if new rules deter older people from driving, he adds: \"The car is often a lifeline for an elderly person and they try and mitigate their fragility - they don't drive at night, they only drive short distances, et cetera.\" \"It's a case of getting the balance right, as it is with younger drivers,\" he says.\n",

      "'We're not all reckless drivers'\n",
      "\n",
      "He also insists that some young people might feel relieved not having the peer-pressure of being a taxi service for their mates who can't drive. And some teenagers in Australia quite like similar restrictions that have already been brought in there, he says. \"Some of them in Australia said they actually prefer [having the rules] because it gives them the chance to build experience for six months by going out with their parents or other adults,\" he tells the BBC. \"So by the time their mates are all in the car, they are a more experienced driver.\" Similar measures - known as graduated driving licensing (GDL) - already exist in Northern Ireland. In Canada, all new drivers face tougher rules regardless of age. Josh Jones, 18, thinks there is some sense behind the proposals. \"I think, in theory, it's a good idea,\" he says. \"A few months ago, one of my high school friends died. I found out that him and two of his friends were killed in a road accident. \"I don't know how it happened. But maybe if a plan like this was in place, that wouldn't have happened.\"\n",

      "The crash happened on the Cambrian Line on a single track, close to a passing loop where opposite travelling trains can pass each other. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said initial evidence suggested the crash occurred at a speed of approximately 24 km/h (15 mph). It said it had deployed a team of inspectors to the site and on initial inspection found evidence that wheel to rail adhesion was relatively low, suggesting the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking. It said low adhesion would be an area of ongoing investigation. But what is low adhesion? \"That’s the jargony way of saying that the trains’ wheels are not gripping the top of the rail properly so you’re getting a sliding situation,\" says rail engineer and rail and transport writer Gareth Dennis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So if the brakes are being applied the train is just sliding along on top of the rail.\" He says it could be caused by fallen leaves \"or sometimes you get very strange combinations of mist and rain that can end up creating a bit of an oily surface on top of the rail head and that’s extremely slippery\". “What will be interesting is understanding why we got to a situation where the rail was so slippery as a train hit another train,\" he says. \"We have systems in place to prevent that from happening and those haven’t worked so we need to understand why and that might require some introspection from the industry.\"\n",

One of the UK's most high-profile train accidents of last year was in September 2023, when the Flying Scotsman collided with stationary carriages at Aviemore Station in the Scottish Highlands, injuring two people. The last train crash in Wales happened in 1991 inside the Severn Tunnel, which allows travel between south-west England and south Wales. On 7 December, 1991, the 08:30 from London Paddington to Cardiff Central was stopped at a signal at the tunnel’s entrance. The train’s driver was advised of a signal failure and told to proceed with caution, but about three miles into the tunnel, it was rear-ended by a class 155 Sprinter travelling from Portsmouth to Cardiff. A total of 185 people were injured in the collision, five of whom were seriously hurt.\n",

      "Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images The Balmoral Hotel clock is in the heart of Edinburgh\n",
      "\n",
      "As people across the UK roll their clocks back to GMT on Sunday, there's one well-loved Scottish clock that will remain at the wrong time. Ever since the Balmoral Hotel clock tower was built in Edinburgh 122 years ago, its time has deliberately been set fast. The peculiar tradition began after intervention by railway officials at Edinburgh Waverley Station, below the clock tower. In the era before mobile phones, when watches were expensive, the clock was well-used by train passengers to watch their time. Officials thought three extra minutes would give travellers more time to collect their tickets, reach their carriages and unload their luggage before the whistle blew. It has been set three minutes fast ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Duncan, chief engineer of the Balmoral Hotel, said the tradition would endure. At 02:00 the clock will be stopped for an hour, and set running again the usual three minutes ahead of time. \"Passersby don't seem to notice as we've never had a complaint about the time being wrong during that hour,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"I think it's because it's happening in the middle of the night.\" The Scottish Baronial-style clock tower was manually changed for daylight savings before it was automated in 2014 - just a few months after Brian took the job of looking after the clock. The change was prompted after it stopped three times over a six week period. Brian said one of the hundreds of cogs inside the original mechanism was slipping. \"I had to make a very big decision - do we continue with the clock being faulty or do we go for a small gear box controlled by a computer,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Duncan said he would always keep the clock running three minutes fast\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We now have a very small gear box compared to the original mechanism and a computer controls it.\" So Brian will be sleeping in his bed when the clocks change. The hands on the four faces of the clock tower cannot be wound, so instead the clock is stopped for one hour in autumn and for 11 hours when the clocks go forward in the spring. \"It's always a Saturday night, so people on Princes Street at that time have usually had a few drinks so no-one really notices,\" he said. The only day the clock tells the true time is during the countdown to the midnight bells during Edinburgh's big Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December. The hotel pays for specialists from Smith of Derby to change the time for just one day to see in the New Year. Then it is set three minutes fast again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Square lights inside the tower illuminate the clock face from behind so passersby can see the time more clearly at night\n",
      "\n",
      "The 62-year-old also explained how the clock keeps its time during the year despite the forces of gravity on the minute hand. \"I was told the weight of gravity makes it faster for the first 30 seconds but then gravity makes it slower on the way back up so it equals out,\" he said. The last time the clock broke down was for more than a month in the summer of 2020 during the Covid lockdown. He now always looks up at it in the morning from his tram journey to work to make sure it is still working. The clock tower, which was designed by William Hamilton Beattie, rises 190ft (58m) into the capital's skyline. The original mechanism, although not used any more, is still in the clock tower. Brian said he hopes one day to have it moved into a more public area of the hotel so visitors can see it. \"It's a massive operation to take it out of the clock tower due to its sheer weight. It's made of steel and weighs at least half a ton.\"\n",

      "\"This is it. This is what it’s all for.\" In four days Rachel Reeves will stand outside No 11 holding the red Budget box up for hordes of press snappers. That moment really will be, as a prominent party figure suggested, a massive moment for Labour - and for the country. On Wednesday, the new government will reveal more about itself than ever before. We’ll know how much tax we’ll all pay, how much cash the government will spend and borrow, and the mighty financial markets will know in detail how the chancellor is changing the rules designed to prevent a public finance meltdown. “Budgets are a moment when the government actually has control,” one minister says. There have been deliberate warnings for months about how tight cash is - how No 11 needs to squeeze the public purse to make ends meet. But others in the Labour movement hope for much more than just a “Treasury budget” driven by balancing the books. They instead want a “Labour budget” - to seize the moment and prioritise public services. As one insider hopes, \"if you’re going to have a Labour government, let’s have a Labour government, not a Treasury government\". It’s a difficult balance, and the government’s attempt to seed expectations may have confused some of the public, a senior MP tells me. “Random members of the public reading it all think, ‘Oh gosh, life is collapsing, the socialist government is taking all our money,’ or you read something else and think, ‘it’s all going to be OK’.” You can read more about the plans we know about here, including Rachel Reeves’ big, planned announcement to change how the country’s enormous public debts are counted. But what will it add up to? What will Labour do with its moment of control?\n",

      "A big bazooka Budget\n",
      "\n",
      "The strapline of the Budget will be “fixing the foundations to deliver change” - not exactly the snappiest slogan in history. But \"fixing the foundations\" is fast becoming a very familiar mantra right across Labour, heard in soundbites, on social media, and in speeches galore - the government’s asking for patience from the public to sort out some deep-rooted problems in the country. And the scale of this Budget is likely to be huge. There is no doubt it will include a major set of measures amounting to billions and billions of pounds of extra tax rises like the hike in National Insurance for employers we’ve confirmed today; billions and billions of pounds of extra borrowing. A government source said: “It is a big budget because there is a hell of a lot to do to get finances back on firmer footing, and to make sure public services can keep going.\" But note the \"to deliver change\" in the Budget strapline as an add on - a sign - that the chancellor is under pressure to spell out what the point of tax rises are, what the merits of squeezing some spending is. If you put up with the pain, what do you get in return? That pressure is behind the chancellor's decision to flex the spending rules she used to boast about being \"ironclad\". She wants billions to spend on roads, rail, to invest, in the hope of getting the economy growing – and extra spending on the health service and also, likely, for schools. We’ll hear more about that tomorrow with Education Secretary Bridget Philipson joining us on the show. As well as a big Budget in monetary terms, it’s a big moment in history too. The first Budget of a government with a gravity-defying majority. The first delivered by a female chancellor. And the first Labour Budget in 15 years.\n",

      "A corrective Budget?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the huge price tag, there’s the purpose. The narrative inside government is that this is a “corrective” moment – essentially, cleaning up the damage done to the public finances by the pandemic, the energy shock, and what Labour would claim were damaging Tory decisions and “covering up” how bad things were in the run up to the summer’s General Election. As you’d expect, Conservatives would argue that the economy had started to turn for the better before they lost - but the independent OBR has said the extent of the problems had been masked. A \"corrective\" certainly sounds like something painful. Sources point to two previous Budgets after big moments of economic peril - the Norman Lamont Budget of 1993 after the disaster of Black Wednesday and George Osborne's 2010 emergency budget after the turmoil of the financial crisis. Both of those Budgets were notable for tax rises. This one won’t be different. Those \"corrections\", along with any big cheques that are written for health, schools or housing, will form the basis of Labour’s narrative. The message they want the public to hear is clear: things went badly wrong, and it's not going to be easy or cheap to fix them. Government sources even pitch this moment as a “last chance” after what they say are years of neglecting public services and running the country’s debt up to sort things out. Reeves will present it as a political choice, a conscious decision that contrasts to the Conservatives' record. \"Investment not decline... stability and an end to chaos.\" One of her allies told me the Budget would be \"political, political, political\", choosing every opportunity to highlight the differences in her approach to the many Tory chancellors in her place before.\n",
      "\n",
      "A political Budget?\n",

      "That will be Reeves' argument – but how it lands with the party and public matters so much. And there are nerves in some quarters of the Labour Party, with some ministers very worried about how amount of cash they will have to spend. One senior source says, “no return to some form of austerity, that is the acid test – we all understand the inheritance, but there are different ways of raising money”. As with any Budget, as one MP says, \"we all have a shopping list\", and every squeeze on spending will have an accompanying howl of: how could you? Budgets can create new problems just as they can solve them. Skimping on the cash for hard-pressed local councils would cause alarm. Scrapping the £2 cap on bus fares would provoke outrage outside London. Raiding the research budget in the science department would cause upset. What about funding for the dental profession when the government is committed to 700,000 extra dental appointments? Every decision has potential pitfalls. A risk of upset, outrage - and even industrial action. A letter passed to the BBC from the Fire Brigades Union to Reeves is demanding a fair settlement for the Fire Service after years of pressure, dangling the possibility of industrial action if it doesn’t happen. There’s even a risk of strikes among pharmacies over funding, and the Royal College of Nurses has rejected ministers' pay offers so far. That's just a short pick of the very long list of dilemmas where money talks, and the chancellor’s been urged to listen.\n",

      "‘Escape the doom loop’\n",
      "\n",
      "Downing Street, both No 10 and 11, hope they can pull off a huge coup this week – to tell the public things will be hard for a while, but convince them that a better country is on the way; that higher taxes will be well spent, public services will get up off their knees, the economy will grow and we’ll all have a stake in it. There remain competing views about how to achieve that. Some are adamant that \"it will be the Labour Budget the whole country’s been waiting for... to escape the doom loop of high taxes, low growth and poor public services\". But even inside the party there’s scepticism about whether they can make it happen - a fear that No 11’s drive to balance the books, even with changed rules, will take over, preventing a bolder and cheerier message from ringing out at a huge moment. Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are fond of saying their number one priority is to grow the economy – and one source says it will not be “a Labour Budget or a Treasury budget, but a Rachel Reeves budget”. One senior figure fears that the “Treasury sees its number one mission as controlling public spending - not creating growth,” citing no difference between the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt and No 11 under Rachel Reeves. A Labour source says that “if it is a Treasury Budget, a technocrat one that focuses more on anything else on balancing the books, then it would be a let down”. Another jokes the plans are “52% Labour, 48% Treasury”, as the party has just been on the side of managing to stick to its political instincts, not the traditional money-saving drive of No 11. And what about the Budget tradition of a “rabbit out of the hat” - a nice surprise at the end of the statement? Not this time. I’m told a group of Labour staffers is eagerly holding a sweepstake about what it could be - but a source suggests, in a bleak financial situation, they stand to be sorely disappointed. “There won’t be any rabbit, it’d be like Watership Down for the poor little sod.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour waited and worked a long time to get back into power. And Rachel Reeves has waited a long time for this moment, to give a Budget statement as chancellor in her dream job. The girl who saved her 20p holiday money, rather than spend it at the toy shop, now in deciding what to save and spend for us all. But the beginning of her and Sir Keir Starmer’s story in government has not been the one they dreamt of. This week is, according to a Labour source, “a golden opportunity to relaunch themselves”. Where the balance lands in Reeves’ big moment could hardly be more significant. Everyone in government understands as this source says: “We absolutely know it is the defining moment for the party and our government, this is it.”\n",

      "'We are in danger' - Spanish anti-tourism spills into winter season\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s well past the August holiday peak, but anger against over-tourism in Spain is spilling into the off-season, as holiday-makers continue to seek winter sun. On Sunday locals in the Basque city of San Sebastian plan to take to the streets under the banner: “We are in danger; degrow tourism!” And in November anti-tourism protesters will gather in Seville. Thousands turned out last Sunday in the Canary Islands, so the problem is clearly not going away. This year appears to have marked a watershed for attitudes to tourism in Spain and many other parts of Europe, as the post-Covid travel boom has seen the industry equal and often surpass records set before the pandemic. Spain is expected to receive more than 90 million foreign visitors by the end of the year. The consultancy firm Braintrust estimates that the number of arrivals will rise to 115 million by 2040, well ahead of the current world leader, France.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tourists go home'\n",
      "\n",
      "This year’s protests began in April, in the Canary Islands, and included a hunger strike by six protesters in Tenerife in an attempt to halt two major tourism projects on the island. They continued in many of the country’s most popular tourist destinations, such as the Balearic Islands, the Mediterranean city of Alicante, cities on the southern coast and Barcelona, where some protesters squirted foreign visitors with water pistols and shouted: “Tourists go home!”. The grievances driving the upcoming protests are similar to those in the summer. “Tourism, which for a few is the golden goose, is an economic model which is choking the rest of us,” said Bizilagunekin (or “with the neighbours”, in the Basque language), the civic association which is organising Sunday’s demonstration in San Sebastian. The protest is the culmination of a series of debates, talks and other events in the city called “October against touristification”. “What we’ve been seeing over the last eight or 10 years has been a huge acceleration of the process of ‘touristification’,” said Asier Basurto, a member of the platform. “All our city’s services have been put at the orders of the tourism industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "He insists the numbers of arrivals themselves are not the problem, it is the way the city caters to visitors rather than residents. Public spaces are adapted for short-term visits and the tourism industry creates precarious jobs, he says. Mr Basurto believes tourists are pushing up rentals, largely because of short-stay accommodation, sending local residents further and further away from San Sebastian’s historic centre. “We’ve had a way of living for generations and generations – in which people are connected to each other and those who arrive are integrated,” he added. “If we have a model whereby people just visit for five days and then leave then it becomes a soulless theme park, without culture, without a community.” The complaint about tourism’s impact on rental rates is a common theme and feeds into a broader housing crisis across Spain. The country’s central bank has reported that nearly half of families who rent at market prices are at risk of poverty or social exclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with tourism representing 13% of Spain’s GDP and directly providing around three million jobs, its supporters insist that the industry is essential to the economy and that it drove the country’s recovery in the wake of the pandemic. They are particularly concerned by scenes such as that on Playa de las Américas in Tenerife on October 20, where one video showed two tourists sunbathing on the beach while protesters chanted just metres away from them. There have also been reports in the Spanish media of more hostile behaviour, such as the locks of tourist apartments in Seville being covered in faeces. Such incidents prompted David Morales, head of tourism for the conservative People’s Party (PP) in the Canary Islands, to insist on “the right of tourists to enjoy their holidays without being the target of interruptions or gestural or verbal attacks, and certainly not physical attacks\".\n",

      "‘Not my King’ protest row highlights Australian divisions\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are not my King': Moment King Charles is heckled by Australian politician\n",
      "\n",
      "When an Aboriginal Australian senator loudly heckled King Charles moments after he delivered a speech in the nation’s Parliament House, it caught the world’s attention. Lidia Thorpe’s cries of “not my King” and “this is not your land” shone a light on a country that is still grappling with its colonial past. But in the debate that followed on the “appropriateness” of Thorpe’s protest, something else became clear: a split within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community itself. In the wake of an unsuccessful referendum which - had it passed - would have granted them constitutional recognition, the question many of Australia’s first inhabitants are now grappling with is how they should go about getting the self-determination they have fought so long for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indigenous Australians are classed as the oldest living culture on earth, and have inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years. But for more than 200 years - since the 1770 arrival of Captain James Cook and subsequent British settlement - they have endured long chapters of colonial violence, including the theft of their lands, livelihoods, and even children. As a result, today, they still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. But, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 4% of the national population, their struggles rarely translate into national voting issues, experts say. Last year’s Voice to Parliament referendum - which asked whether Australia should recognise its first inhabitants in the constitution and allow them a body to advise the parliament - was a key exception. The result was a resounding ‘No’, with one major analysis of the data suggesting many voters found the proposal divisive and ineffective.\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA The Voice to Parliament proposal was decisively rejected in a referendum last year\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the figures indicate a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic and “an easy way to fake progress”. But Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman and activist, says the ‘No’ outcome left most Indigenous Australians with “a sense of humiliation and rejection”. She adds that the debate itself - which saw countless examples of misinformation and disinformation - unleashed a wave of “racist rhetoric” that their communities are still recovering from. The big-picture impact of the Voice, Ms Baldwin-Roberts argues, has been a growing sentiment that traditional reconciliation efforts are “dead”. Those approaches have long tried to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through polite dialogue and education. It was against this backdrop that Thorpe made her protest in parliament. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t see you,” Ms Baldwin-Roberts tells the BBC. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t think that you deserve justice.” Ms Baldwin-Roberts says “new strategies” are needed to disrupt the status quo. She sees Thorpe’s protest as “incredibly brave” and reflective of conversations many First Nations people are having. “There are Indigenous communities around the country talking about our stolen children, our stolen histories - but she had access to that room. As an Australian senator she knows she’s going to get media, and it’s important to make this a talking point.”\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA Australia Day - held on the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet arriving at Sydney Cove - has become an annual target of protests\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Williams, who is of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, agreed. “After the [referendum] last year, what do Indigenous people have left? How can we find [an] audience with the monarch to effect change?” he asked a political panel on the ABC. “We're talking about 200 years of pain that is continuing to be unanswered and unresolved.” But others see it differently: there is a long history of Indigenous leaders petitioning the Royal Family to recognise their peoples’ struggle, but the independent’s senator’s act - for some - went too far. Nova Peris, a former senator who was the first Aboriginal woman in parliament, described it as an “embarrassing” move which didn’t “reflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large”. Both sides of parliament dismissed it as disrespectful and a failed attempt at grandstanding. Prof Tom Calma, a Kungarakan and Iwaidja man who was in the room, said it risked alienating “the other 96%” of Australia’s population who may not “see or understand the enduring impacts of colonisation”. “I don’t think the protest - the way that Senator Thorpe went about it - brings people along with us. And in the spirit of reconciliation, we need allies.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel has carried out what it described as “precise and targeted” airstrikes on Iran in retaliation for the barrage of missile strikes launched by Tehran against Israel earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of exchanges between the two countries that for months have sparked fears of an all-out regional war. But while Iran says Saturday's strikes against military sites killed four soldiers, early indications suggest the attacks were more limited than had been feared. Here’s what we know.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did the attacks unfold?\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 02:15 local time (22:45 GMT on Friday), Iranian media reported explosions in and around the capital, Tehran. Video uploaded to social media and verified by the BBC showed projectiles in the sky over the city, while residents in some areas reported hearing loud booms. Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it was carrying out “precise” strikes on “military targets” in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv. Just after 06:00 (03:00 GMT), the IDF said the strikes had concluded. The White House described the strikes as an “exercise of self-defence”. A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a \"targeted and proportional\" response.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the scale of the attacks?\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent of the attacks - and the damage caused - remains unclear at this stage. The IDF said it hit around 20 targets, including missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air-missiles and other military sites. The Iranian military confirmed that two soldiers had died “while battling projectiles”. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were targeted. The country’s air defence said it had “successfully intercepted” the attacks, but that “some areas sustained limited damage”. BBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south. A senior US administration official said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities, targets President Joe Biden had urged Israel not to hit. Syrian state media also reported strikes on military sites in central and southern Syria, though Israel has not confirmed striking the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did Israel attack Iran?\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with. In April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on an Iranian embassy compound in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to. Later, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment. In late September, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut. On October 1, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan. Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran?\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond. \"Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,\" the prime minister's spokesperson said. Still, early signs indicate this attack was not as serious as some had feared. The IDF said in a statement that \"we are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation\". A senior US official said \"this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran\". Iran’s foreign ministry said it was \"entitled and obligated to defend itself\" and described the attack as a violation of international law. But it also said that Tehran recognises its \"responsibilities towards regional peace and security\".\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the situation in Iran?\n",
      "\n",
      "Images published by Iranian state media show life continuing in relative normality - with busy streets, people exercising in parks, and fruit and vegetable markets open as usual. Iran closed its airspace for a few hours overnight, but it later reopened and there are several commercial flights in the air across the country. But there are signs the Iranian government are keen to play down the impact of the attacks. The IRGC has announced that it is a criminal offense to send “images or news” related to the attack to outlets that it deems \"Israel-affiliated\" or \"hostile”. Usually, Iran refers to Western media as hostile. Iranian media reported today that Tehran's Prosecutor Office has filed charges against an unnamed website for “covering issues counter to national security\".\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a phone call from a 13-year-old girl in Scotland in 2019 that eventually led to the capture of a social media predator described as one of the world's most prolific child sex abusers. Alexander McCartney from Northern Ireland pretended to be a teenage girl to befriend, then abuse and blackmail children around the world, often sharing images with other paedophiles. Some of the children were as young as four. Some had never told anyone what they had been through - until police knocked on their door. McCartney gradually admitted 185 charges including manslaughter after a 12-year-old girl he was abusing took her own life. He has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did police do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following contact from police in Scotland, an urgent investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) swung into operation in March 2019. Detectives identified the home address of Alexander McCartney, arrested and interviewed him. Sixty-four of McCartney’s devices were seized at his home in the rural Lissummon Road area outside Newry in four separate raids. Those devices held hundreds of thousands of indecent photos and videos of underage girls performing sexual acts while being blackmailed. McCartney made and used many fake accounts on online platforms, mainly Snapchat, to entrap and manipulate them. PSNI Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan said McCartney had been \"offending on an industrial scale\". He groomed victims into thinking they were talking online to a girl of a similar age, before encouraging them to send indecent images or engage in sexual activity via webcam or a mobile phone. McCartney used the same pattern every time, the detective said, adding: \"He threatened to share these images online for the pleasure of other paedophiles and use them to further abuse and harass the already terrified and exploited children.\" In one incident, it took McCartney just nine minutes to groom, sexually abuse and blackmail a girl of only 12 years of age.\n",

      "As time went on, it became clear that McCartney's depravity spanned not just across the UK, but across the world. The abuse included involving other people, family pets and objects. The PSNI worked with colleagues in the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Public Prosecution Service and National Crime Agency, and victims were located in America, New Zealand and at least 28 other countries. Many of these children were only identified through the evidence detectives located on McCartney’s devices. According to the police, he \"built a paedophile enterprise\" and had \"stolen childhoods\" of his victims.\n",

      "In the spring of 2019, police called Catherine Kierans, acting head of the Public Prosecution Service’s serious crime unit. They said something \"big was unfolding... it involved catfishing\". Catfishing is where a person creates a false identity to gain the trust of people and exploit them. Ms Kierans said little girls \"an average age of 10-12 years old [were] being threatened in the most depraved way.\" She said some of the children who had been exploited had previously opened up about their abuse, others had remained silent. “Some of the children had raised the alarm, which helped police to actually identify him in the first place. \"But some of the children, until police knocked the door, they had never told anyone what they'd been through.” According to Ms Kierans, McCartney offended \"around the clock\".\n",

      "As the investigation spread across the globe, Ms Kierans said prosecutors realised McCartney had been \"very assiduous about saving the images\". \"He would also save the map on Snapchat of where the child was in some cases, and that then enabled police to locate the children.” His arraignment in 2021 was delayed as police discovered the suicide of a little girl in West Virginia, USA. “From the beginning, the level of abuse was so horrific that we were fearful that when these children were identified, would they be okay?” Ms Kierans said. “Unfortunately, our worst fears were realised when we discovered, some way in, that one of the little girls had taken her own life. “Working closely with the American authorities, we were able to prove that this child took her own life during the abuse, when she was still online with McCartney. \"At that point, the death of the child was so intrinsically linked to the abuse that we felt we had a strong case to say that he killed her.\"\n",

      "That little girl was 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas who, in 2018, shot herself while McCartney was abusing her. McCartney was charged with her manslaughter. Ms Kierans said it is believed to be the first time an abuser anywhere in the world has been held accountable for manslaughter where the victim and perpetrator have never met in person. Such was the magnitude of the case that prosecutors had to be judicious with the charges. “We couldn't put 3,000 charges on the indictment,” Ms Kierans said. “In the end, there were about 200 charges [relating to around 70 victims] which is probably one of the largest indictments that we've seen in Northern Ireland.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "McCartney grew up five miles outside of Newry and just off the main road to Armagh city. It’s about as rural as it gets. Farms, a church and a few businesses. When he first appeared at Newry Magistrates' Court in July 2019 he was just 21, with long, fuzzy hair and the wide-eyed look of someone surprised to be sitting where he was. He has spent more than five years on remand at Maghaberry Prison – leaving only for court appearances and further questioning by the police. In those hearings, he said little other than to confirm his name and date of birth and to gradually enter softly-spoken guilty pleas.\n",

      "Some of the messages that McCartney sent to his victims on Snapchat\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nothing extraordinary about him'\n",
      "\n",
      "McCartney attended Newry High School and was into gaming. One source told BBC News NI: \"He was introverted and socially awkward. He didn’t interact with people much outside of his group of friends. \"He was maybe at the edges of things, but he had friends who obviously knew nothing about this.\" He then took a course at the Southern Regional College in Newry where he was described as \"quiet and didn't really get involved with the rest of the class\". When he was eventually charged in 2019 he was a computer science student at Ulster University. For those living in and around his home, the case has been harrowing. “The whole place was stunned,” one resident said. “It was whispers at the start, then disbelief. I’m sure people talk about it in their own homes but it doesn’t get discussed publicly as people don’t know what to say.\" Another said: “He came across as a pleasant, affable, intelligent young man. \"There is nothing extraordinary about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is extraordinary is the enormity of his offending; many of his victims had pleaded for the abuse to stop but prosecutors said he \"callously continued, at times forcing the victims to involve younger children, some aged just four\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander McCartney was 'relentless and cruel'\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Catherine Kierans, McCartney's depravity was such that it was \"one of the most distressing and prolific cases of child sexual abuse we have ever seen in the PPS\". Ms Kierans said some of the victims have still never been identified despite exhaustive efforts by police. \"McCartney's crimes have harmed thousands of children and left them and their families dealing with the traumatic aftermath,\" she said. \"Their courage stands in stark contrast to his cowardice in targeting vulnerable young girls.\"\n",

      "Alan Hartley was never supposed to open a fruit and veg shop. A career in engineering was on the cards for the-then 19-year-old, but Alan's eyes and heart were set on running his own mobile store. He spoke to mum Janet and dad Albert and had a chat with the council about his options. In November 1960, while still a teenager, he took control of an empty unit at what would become known as the Gaunt Shopping Centre - it wasn't on wheels, but it was his. On Friday, 64 years later, Alan pulled down the shutter for the final time on local retail institution AE Hartley & Son. When we meet him, Alan, now 83, surveys the scene around the shop, including new buildings and the empty neighbouring stores in which the tills went quiet a long time ago. \"We'd be looking at a field now,\" he says, gazing across the concrete precinct. \"Not a big brick wall at the back of a chemist.

They are happily reminiscing about the memories that have been created over butter, potatoes, toothpaste and toilet cleaner during the years they have worked there. A steady stream of customers comes through the door to offer well wishes. Some leave cards. Many are emotional. \"We've had tears from several customers. I'm saving mine for a bit,\" says Janet, Alan's 89-year-old sister who has been at his side since the start. She left a job in insurance, deciding that working with family in the shop suited her better. \"We're a big family. That’s our strength. When it's backs to the wall.

Fresh produce was lined up and displayed in boxes outside the front of the store on a well-swept pavement in the Gleadless area, about three miles south east of Sheffield city centre. Potatoes would arrive in huge wooden crates and have to be lugged up from the cellar. Alan’s eldest son Lee, now 51, remembers watching on a child as his father and grandfather struggled with the \"back-breaking work\" of moving huge quantities of potatoes around. \"In the early 60s people weren’t eating rice and pasta so we sold tonnes and tonnes of spuds. \"After a couple of years Dad realised the heavy lifting would kill him so he invested in a conveyer belt,\" he says.

      "BBC Yusely Perez says she was forced to collect firewood to burn for cooking\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuba has endured one of its toughest weeks in years after a nationwide blackout which left around 10 million Cubans without power for several days. Adding to the Caribbean island’s problems, Hurricane Oscar left a trail of destruction along the north-eastern coast, leaving several dead and causing widespread damage. For some communities in Cuba the energy crisis is the new normal. As Cuba approached its fourth day without power this week, Yusely Perez turned to the only fuel source left available to her: firewood. Her neighbourhood in Havana hasn’t received its regular deliveries of liquified gas cannisters for two months. So once the island’s entire electrical grid went down, prompting a nationwide blackout, Yusely was forced to take desperate measures. “Me and my husband went all over the city, but we couldn’t find charcoal anywhere,” she explains. “We had to collect firewood wherever we found it on the street. Thankfully it was dry enough to cook with.” Yusely nodded at the yucca chips frying slowly in a pot of lukewarm oil. “We’ve gone two days without eating,” she adds.\n",

      "AFP Cuba's energy infrastructure needs more investment, economists say\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking last Sunday, at the height of what was Cuba’s most acute energy crisis in years, the country’s energy and mines minister, Vicente de la O Levy, blamed the problems for the country’s creaking electrical infrastructure on what he called the “brutal” US economic embargo on Cuba. The embargo, he argued, made it impossible to import new parts to overhaul the grid or bring in enough fuel to run the power stations, even to access credit in the international banking system. The US State Department retorted that the problems with energy production in Cuba did not lie at Washington’s door - but argued that it was due to the Cuban government’s own mismanagement. Normal service would be resumed soon, the Cuban minister insisted. But no sooner did he utter those words than there was another total collapse of the grid, the fourth in 48 hours. At night, the full extent of the blackout became clear. Havana’s streets were plunged into near total darkness as residents sat on the doorsteps in the stifling heat, their faces lit up by their mobile phones – as long as their batteries lasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Residents of Havana were without electricity at night\n",
      "\n",
      "Some, like restaurant worker Victor, were prepared to openly criticise the authorities. “The people who run this country are the ones who have all the answers,” he says. “But they’re going to have to explain themselves to the Cuban people.” Specifically, the state’s decision to invest heavily in tourism, rather than energy infrastructure, frustrated him most during the blackout. “They’ve built so many hotels in the past few years. Everyone knows that a hotel doesn’t cost a couple of bucks. It costs 300 or 400 million dollars.” “So why is our energy infrastructure collapsing?” he asks. “Either they’re not investing in it or, if they are, then it’s not been to the benefit of the people.” Aware of the growing discontentment, President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on state TV wearing the traditional olive-green fatigues of the Cuban revolution. If that message wasn’t clear enough, he directly warned people against protesting over the blackout. The authorities would not “tolerate” vandalism, he said, or any attempt to “disrupt the social order”.\n",

      "The protests of July 2021, when hundreds were arrested amid widespread demonstrations following a series of blackouts, were fresh in the memory. On this occasion, there were only a handful of reports of isolated incidents. Yet the question of where Cuba chooses to direct its scarce resources remains a real point of contention on the island. “When we talk about energy infrastructure, that refers to both generation and distribution or transmission. In every step, a lot of investment is needed,” says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres, at the American University in Washington DC. Electricity generation in Cuba has recently fallen well below what’s required, only supplying some 60-70% of the national demand. The shortfall is a “huge and serious gap” which is now being felt across the island, says Mr Torres. By the government’s own figures, Cuba’s national electricity generation dropped by around 2.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, part of a downward trend which has seen a staggering 25% drop in production since 2019. “It’s important to understand that last week’s problem in the energy grid isn’t something that happens overnight,” says Mr Torres.\n",

For Marbeyis, even “normal service” being restored still means most of the day without power. In fact, what the residents of Havana endured for a few days is what daily life is like in her village of Aguacate in the province of Artemisa, outside Havana. “We’ve had no power for six days”, she says, brewing coffee on a makeshift charcoal stove inside her breeze-block, tin-roofed shack. “It came on for a couple of hours last night and then went out again. We have no choice but to cook like this or use firewood to provide something warm for the children,” she adds. Her two gas hobs and one electric ring sit idle on the kitchen top, the room filling with smoke. The community is in dire need of state assistance, she says, listing their most urgent priorities. “First, electricity. Secondly, we need water. Food is running out. People with dollars, sent from abroad, can buy food. But we don’t have any so we can’t buy anything.”\n",

Her husband’s manual labour also requires electricity and he’s stuck at home waiting for the instruction to come to work. The Cuban Government was due to recall state workers by Thursday – but to avoid another collapse in the grid, all non-essential work and schools have now been suspended until next week. “It’s especially hard on the children”, Marbeyis adds, her eyes tearing up, “because when they say I want this or that, we have nothing to give them.” Living without a reliable energy source is the new normal in places like Aguacate.

      "The UK needs to make huge cuts to its greenhouse gas emissions this decade to help the world avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, the government's climate watchdog has said. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says the UK has the technologies to do this, but meeting the goal would require much greater investment in renewable energy, electric cars and heat pumps. While the UK has already cut its emissions by more than 50% since 1990, the CCC says it should extend this to 81% by 2035, which would make a \"credible contribution\" to the international goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. A spokesperson said the government would carefully consider the CCC’s advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the government commits to the suggested target, it would represent a significant advance on the UK’s current international pledge to cut emissions by 68% by 2030. It is, however, broadly in line with the UK’s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050.\n",

      "These figures do not include emissions from products manufactured abroad and imported, nor those from international flights and shipping, in line with UN standards. The UK’s relative success so far has been largely down to cleaning up electricity, with progress in other areas, such as home heating, proving more difficult. But the CCC is confident that the UK’s targets are still possible. “All the core technologies have got cheaper, and they keep getting cheaper, and that's what gives us more and more confidence that we'll be able to achieve this very ambitious level of emissions reductions,” Nigel Topping, member of the CCC, told BBC News Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt.\n",
