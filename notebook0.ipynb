Trump decided to take a day off the battleground campaign trail in the waning days of the race to hold a rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden, it prompted a question from many political observers: Why?\\n\\nNew York is hardly a battleground state, and New York City is still a Democratic stronghold. So how come Mr. Trump is planning an event in Midtown Manhattan in the final two weeks of his presidential campaign?\\n\\nHere are five reasons:\\n\\nHe will get to see his name in lights.\\n\\nMr. Trump was a performer and reality TV star before he was a political candidate and president. (It is worth recalling that at the Republican National Convention this summer in Milwaukee, Mr. Trump appeared onstage with a Broadway-style light display spelling out T-R-U-M-P.)\\n\\nFor years, Mr. Trump has measured the significance of his rally venues in part by who had appeared there before. And his yardsticks were usually not other politicians, but singers and other celebrities.', 'images': {'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26POL-TRUMP-MSG-fqvb/26POL-TRUMP-MSG-fqvb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/26/multimedia/26POL-TRUMP-MSG-fqvb/26POL-TRUMP-MSG-fqvb-facebookJumbo.jpg'}, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-rally-madison-square-garden.html'}\n"
